EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Executive Summary


# Introduction
1.  In 2003, for the first time since the Second World War, the United Kingdom took part 
in an opposed invasion and full‑scale occupation of a sovereign State – Iraq. Cabinet 
decided on 17 March to join the US‑led invasion of Iraq, assuming there was no 
last‑minute capitulation by Saddam Hussein. That decision was ratified by Parliament 
the next day and implemented the night after that. 

2.  Until 28 June 2004, the UK was a joint Occupying Power in Iraq. For the next five 
years, UK forces remained in Iraq with responsibility for security in the South‑East; and 
the UK sought to assist with stabilisation and reconstruction.

3.  The consequences of the invasion and of the conflict within Iraq which followed are still 
being felt in Iraq and the wider Middle East, as well as in the UK. It left families bereaved 
and many individuals wounded, mentally as well as physically. After harsh deprivation 
under Saddam Hussein’s regime, the Iraqi people suffered further years of violence.

4.  The decision to use force – a very serious decision for any government to take – 
provoked profound controversy in relation to Iraq and became even more controversial 
when it was subsequently found that Iraq’s programmes to develop and produce 
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons had been dismantled. It continues to shape 
debates on national security policy and the circumstances in which to intervene.

5.  Although the Coalition had achieved the removal of a brutal regime which had 
defied the United Nations and which was seen as a threat to peace and security, it 
failed to achieve the goals it had set for a new Iraq. Faced with serious disorder in Iraq, 
aggravated by sectarian differences, the US and UK struggled to contain the situation. 
The lack of security impeded political, social and economic reconstruction. 

6.  The Inquiry’s report sets out in detail decision‑making in the UK Government covering 
the period from when the possibility of military action first arose in 2001 to the departure 
of UK troops in 2009. It covers many different aspects of policy and its delivery.

7.  In this Executive Summary the Inquiry sets out its conclusions on a number of issues 
that have been central to the controversies surrounding Iraq. In addition to the factors 
that shaped the decision to take military action in March 2003 without support for an 
authorising resolution in the UN Security Council, they are: the assessments of Iraqi 
WMD capabilities by the intelligence community prior to the invasion (including their 
presentation in the September 2002 dossier); advice on whether military action would be 
legal; the lack of adequate preparation for the post‑conflict period and the consequent 
struggle to cope with the deteriorating security situation in Iraq after the invasion. 
This Summary also contains the Inquiry’s key findings and a compilation of lessons, from 
the conclusions of individual Sections of the report.

8.  Other Sections of the report contain detailed accounts of the relevant decisions and 
events, and the Inquiry’s full conclusions and lessons. 

9.  The following are extracts from the main body of the Report covering some of the 
most important issues considered by the Inquiry.

# Pre‑conflict strategy and planning
10.  After the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 and the fall of the Taliban regime 
in Afghanistan in November, the US Administration turned its attention to regime change 
in Iraq as part of the second phase of what it called the Global War on Terror.

11.  The UK Government sought to influence the decisions of the US Administration and 
avoid unilateral US military action on Iraq by offering partnership to the US and seeking 
to build international support for the position that Iraq was a threat with which it was 
necessary to deal. 

12.  In Mr Blair’s view, the decision to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US was an 
essential demonstration of solidarity with the UK’s principal ally as well as being in the 
UK’s long‑term national interests.

13.  To do so required the UK to reconcile its objective of disarming Iraq, if possible 
by peaceful means, with the US goal of regime change. That was achieved by the 
development of an ultimatum strategy threatening the use of force if Saddam Hussein 
did not comply with the demands of the international community, and by seeking to 
persuade the US to adopt that strategy and pursue it through the UN.

14.  President Bush’s decision, in September 2002, to challenge the UN to deal with 
Iraq, and the subsequent successful negotiation of resolution 1441 giving Iraq a final 
opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations or face serious consequences 
if it did not, was perceived to be a major success for Mr Blair’s strategy and his influence 
on President Bush.

15.  But US willingness to act through the UN was limited. Following the Iraqi declaration 
of 7 December 2002, the UK perceived that President Bush had decided that the US 
would take military action in early 2003 if Saddam Hussein had not been disarmed and 
was still in power.

16.  The timing of military action was entirely driven by the US Administration. 

17.  At the end of January 2003, Mr Blair accepted the US timetable for military action 
by mid‑March. President Bush agreed to support a second resolution to help Mr Blair.

18.  The UK Government’s efforts to secure a second resolution faced opposition 
from those countries, notably France, Germany and Russia, which believed that the 
inspections process could continue. The inspectors reported that Iraqi co‑operation, 
while far from perfect, was improving.


19.  By early March, the US Administration was not prepared to allow inspections 
to continue or give Mr Blair more time to try to achieve support for action. The attempt 
to gain support for a second resolution was abandoned. 

20.  In the Inquiry’s view, the diplomatic options had not at that stage been exhausted. 
Military action was therefore not a last resort. 

21.  In mid‑March, Mr Blair’s determination to stand alongside the US left the UK 
with a stark choice. It could act with the US but without the support of the majority 
of the Security Council in taking military action if Saddam Hussein did not accept 
the US ultimatum giving him 48 hours to leave. Or it could choose not to join US‑led 
military action.

22.  Led by Mr Blair, the UK Government chose to support military action. 

23.  Mr Blair asked Parliament to endorse a decision to invade and occupy a sovereign 
nation, without the support of a Security Council resolution explicitly authorising the use 
of force. Parliament endorsed that choice.

# The UK decision to support US military action
24.  President Bush decided at the end of 2001 to pursue a policy of regime change 
in Iraq.

25.  The UK shared the broad objective of finding a way to deal with Saddam Hussein’s 
defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and his assumed weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD) programmes. However, based on consistent legal advice, the UK 
could not share the US objective of regime change. The UK Government therefore set 
as its objective the disarmament of Iraq in accordance with the obligations imposed in a 
series of Security Council resolutions.

UK policy before 9/11
26.  Before the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 (9/11), the UK was pursuing 
a strategy of containment based on a new sanctions regime to improve international 
support and incentivise Iraq’s co‑operation, narrowing and deepening the sanctions 
regime to focus only on prohibited items and at the same time improving financial 
controls to reduce the flow of illicit funds to Saddam Hussein.

27.  When UK policy towards Iraq was formally reviewed and agreed by the Ministerial 
Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy (DOP) in May 1999, the objectives towards 
Iraq were defined as: 

“... in the short term, to reduce the threat Saddam poses to the region including 
by eliminating his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes; and, in 

the longer term, to reintegrate a territorially intact Iraq as a law‑abiding member 
of the international community.”1 

28.  The policy of containment was seen as the “only viable way” to pursue those 
objectives. A “policy of trying to topple Saddam would command no useful international 
support”. Iraq was unlikely to accept the package immediately but “might be persuaded 
to acquiesce eventually”.

29.  After prolonged discussion about the way ahead, the UN Security Council adopted 
resolution 1284 in December 1999, although China, France and Russia abstained.2 

30.  The resolution established:

*  a new inspectorate, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection 

Commission (UNMOVIC) (which Dr Hans Blix was subsequently appointed 
to lead); 

*  a timetable to identify and agree a work programme; and
*  the principle that, if the inspectors reported co‑operation in key areas, that would 

lead to the suspension of economic sanctions.3 

31.  Resolution 1284 described Iraq’s obligations to comply with the disarmament 
standards of resolution 687 and other related resolutions as the “governing standard 
of Iraqi compliance”; and provided that the Security Council would decide what was 
required of Iraq for the implementation of each task and that it should be “clearly defined 
and precise”. 

32.  The resolution was also a deliberate compromise which changed the criterion for 
the suspension, and eventual lifting, of sanctions from complete disarmament to tests 
which would be based on judgements by UNMOVIC on the progress made in completing 
identified tasks. 

33.  Iraq refused to accept the provisions of resolution 1284, including the re‑admission 
of weapons inspectors. Concerns about Iraq’s activities in the absence of inspectors 
increased. 

34.  The US Presidential election in November 2000 prompted a further UK review of the 
operation of the containment policy (see Section 1.2). There were concerns about how 
long the policy could be sustained and what it could achieve. 

35.  There were also concerns over both the continued legal basis for operations in the 
No‑Fly Zones (NFZs) and the conduct of individual operations.4

36.  In an Assessment on 1 November, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) judged 
that Saddam Hussein felt “little pressure to negotiate over ... resolution 1284 because 
the proceeds of oil smuggling and illicit trade have increased significantly this year, and 
more countries are increasing diplomatic contacts and trade with Iraq”.5 

37.  The JIC also judged:

“Saddam would only contemplate co‑operation with [resolution] 1284, and the return 
of inspectors ... if it could be portrayed as a victory. He will not agree to co‑operate 
unless:
*  there is a UN‑agreed timetable for the lifting of sanctions. Saddam suspects 
*  he is able to negotiate with the UN in advance to weaken the inspection 

that the US would not agree to sanctions lift while he remained in power;

provisions. His ambitions to rebuild Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction 
programmes makes him hostile to intrusive inspections or any other constraints 
likely to be effective.

“Before accepting 1284, Saddam will try to obtain the abolition of the No‑Fly Zones. 
He is also likely to demand that the US should abandon its stated aim to topple the 
Iraqi regime.”

38.  In November 2000, Mr Blair’s “preferred option” was described as the 
implementation of 1284, enabling inspectors to return and sanctions to be suspended.6

39.  In December 2000, the British Embassy Washington reported growing pressure 
to change course from containment to military action to oust Saddam Hussein, 
but no decision to change policy or to begin military planning had been taken by 
President Clinton.7 

40.  The Key Judgements of a JIC Assessment in February 2001 included:

*  There was “broad international consensus to maintain the arms embargo 
at least as long as Saddam remains in power. Saddam faces no economic 
pressure to accept ... [resolution] 1284 because he is successfully 
undermining the economic sanctions regime.”

*  “Through abuse of the UN Oil‑for‑Food [OFF] programme and smuggling of 

oil and other goods” it was estimated that Saddam Hussein would “be able to 
appropriate in the region of $1.5bn to $1.8bn in cash and goods in 2001”, 
and there was “scope for earning even more”.

*  “Iranian interdiction efforts” had “significantly reduced smuggling down 

the Gulf”, but Saddam Hussein had “compensated by exploiting land routes 
to Turkey and Syria”. 

*  “Most countries” believed that economic sanctions were “ineffective, 

counterproductive and should now be lifted. Without active enforcement, 
the economic sanctions regime” would “continue to erode”.8 

41.  The Assessment also stated:

*  Saddam Hussein needed funds “to maintain his military and security apparatus 
*  Despite the availability of funds, Iraq had been slow to comply with UN 
recommendations on food allocation. Saddam needed “the Iraqi people 
to suffer to underpin his campaign against sanctions”.

*  Encouraged by the success of Iraq’s border trade agreement with Turkey, 
*  There had been a “significant increase in the erosion of sanctions over 

“front‑line states” were “not enforcing sanctions”.

the past six months”.

42.  When Mr Blair had his first meeting with President Bush at Camp David in late 
February 2001, the US and UK agreed on the need for a policy which was more widely 
supported in the Middle East region.9 Mr Blair had concluded that public presentation 
needed to be improved. He suggested that the approach should be presented as a 
“deal” comprising four elements:

*  do the right thing by the Iraqi people, with whom we have no quarrel;
*  tighten weapons controls on Saddam Hussein;
*  retain financial control on Saddam Hussein; and
*  retain our ability to strike. 

43.  The stated position of the UK Government in February 2001 was that containment 
had been broadly successful.10 

44.  During the summer of 2001, the UK had been exploring the way forward with the 
US, Russia and France on a draft Security Council resolution to put in place a “smart 
sanctions” regime.11 But there was no agreement on the way ahead between the UK, the 
US, China, France and Russia, the five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council.

45.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, until 11 September 2001, the UK had a policy of 
containment, but sanctions were eroding.12 The policy was “partially successful”, 
but it did not mean that Saddam Hussein was “not still developing his [prohibited] 
programmes”. 

# The impact of 9/11
46.  The attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 changed perceptions about the 
severity and likelihood of the threat from international terrorism. They showed that 
attacks intended to cause large‑scale civilian casualties could be mounted anywhere 
in the world. 

47.  In response to that perception of a greater threat, governments felt a responsibility 
to act to anticipate and reduce risks before they turned into a threat. That was described 
to the Inquiry by a number of witnesses as a change to the “calculus of risk” after 9/11.

48.  In the wake of the attacks, Mr Blair declared that the UK would stand “shoulder 
to shoulder” with the US to defeat and eradicate international terrorism.13 

49.  The JIC assessed on 18 September that the attacks on the US had “set a new 
benchmark for terrorist atrocity”, and that terrorists seeking comparable impact 
might try to use chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear devices.14 Only Islamic 
extremists such as those who shared Usama Bin Laden’s agenda had the motivation 
to pursue attacks with the deliberate aim of causing maximum casualties. 

50.  Throughout the autumn of 2001, Mr Blair took an active and leading role in 
building a coalition to act against that threat, including military action against Al Qaida 
and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. He also emphasised the potential risk of 
terrorists acquiring and using nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, and the 
dangers of inaction.

51.  In November 2001, the JIC assessed that Iraq had played no role in the 9/11 attacks 
on the US and that practical co‑operation between Iraq and Al Qaida was “unlikely”.15 
There was no “credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD‑related technology and 
expertise to terrorist groups”. It was possible that Iraq might use WMD in terrorist 
attacks, but only if the regime was under serious and imminent threat of collapse. 

52.  The UK continued actively to pursue a strengthened policy of containing Iraq, 
through a revised and more targeted sanctions regime and seeking Iraq’s agreement 
to the return of inspectors as required by resolution 1284 (1999).

14 JIC Assessment, 18 September 2001, ‘UK Vulnerability to Major Terrorist Attack’.
15 JIC Assessment, 28 November 2001, ‘Iraq after September 11 – The Terrorist Threat’.

53.  The adoption on 29 November 2001 of resolution 1382 went some way towards that 
objective. But support for economic sanctions was eroding and whether Iraq would ever 
agree to re‑admit weapons inspectors and allow them to operate without obstruction was 
in doubt.

54.  Although there was no evidence of links between Iraq and Al Qaida, Mr Blair 
encouraged President Bush to address the issue of Iraq in the context of a wider 
strategy to confront terrorism after the attacks of 9/11. He sought to prevent precipitate 
military action by the US which he considered would undermine the success of the 
coalition which had been established for action against international terrorism. 

55.  President Bush’s remarks16 on 26 November renewed UK concerns that US 
attention was turning towards military action in Iraq. 

56.  Following a discussion with President Bush on 3 December, Mr Blair sent him 
a paper on a second phase of the war against terrorism.17 

57.  On Iraq, Mr Blair suggested a strategy for regime change in Iraq. This would build 
over time until the point was reached where “military action could be taken if necessary”, 
without losing international support. 

58.  The strategy was based on the premise that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt 
with, and it had multiple diplomatic strands. It entailed renewed demands for Iraq to 
comply with the obligations imposed by the Security Council and for the re‑admission 
of weapons inspectors, and a readiness to respond firmly if Saddam Hussein failed 
to comply. 

59.  Mr Blair did not, at that stage, have a ground invasion of Iraq or immediate military 
action of any sort in mind. The strategy included mounting covert operations in support 
of those “with the ability to topple Saddam”. But Mr Blair did state that, when a rebellion 
occurred, the US and UK should “back it militarily”. 

60.  That was the first step towards a policy of possible intervention in Iraq.

61.  A number of issues, including the legal basis for any military action, would need 
to be resolved as part of developing the strategy.

62.  The UK Government does not appear to have had any knowledge at that stage 
that President Bush had asked General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief, 
US Central Command, to review the military options for removing Saddam Hussein, 
including options for a conventional ground invasion. 

63.  Mr Blair also emphasised the threat which Iraq might pose in the future. 
That remained a key part of his position in the months that followed.

Afghanistan.
17 Paper [Blair to Bush], 4 December 2001, ‘The War against Terrorism: The Second Phase’. 


64.  In his annual State of the Union speech on 29 January 2002, President Bush 
described the regimes in North Korea and Iran as “sponsors of terrorism”.18 He added 
that Iraq had continued to:

“... flaunt its hostility towards America and to support terror ... The Iraqi regime has 
plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. 
This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own 
citizens ... This is a regime that agreed to international inspections – then kicked out 
the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.”

65.  President Bush stated: 

“States like these [North Korea, Iran and Iraq], and their terrorist allies, constitute an 
axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass 
destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger.” 

66.  From late February 2002, Mr Blair and Mr Straw began publicly to argue that Iraq 
was a threat which had to be dealt with. Iraq needed to disarm or be disarmed.

67.  The urgency and certainty with which the position was stated reflected the 
ingrained belief that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and biological warfare 
capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible enhance its capabilities, 
including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and was pursuing an active 
policy of deception and concealment. It also reflected the wider context in which the 
policy was being discussed with the US.

68.  On 26 February 2002, Sir Richard Dearlove, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence 
Service, advised that the US Administration had concluded that containment would 
not work, was drawing up plans for a military campaign later in the year, and was 
considering presenting Saddam Hussein with an ultimatum for the return of inspectors 
while setting the bar “so high that Saddam Hussein would be unable to comply”.19

69.  The following day, the JIC assessed that Saddam Hussein feared a US military 
attack on the scale of the 1991 military campaign to liberate Kuwait but did not regard 
such an attack as inevitable; and that Iraqi opposition groups would not act without 
“visible and sustained US military support on the ground”.20

70.  At Cabinet on 7 March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw emphasised that no decisions 
to launch further military action had been taken and any action taken would be in 
accordance with international law.

19 Letter C to Manning, 26 February 2002, ‘US Policy on Iraq’. 
20 JIC Assessment, 27 February 2002, ‘Iraq: Saddam Under the Spotlight’. 

71.  The discussion in Cabinet was couched in terms of Iraq’s need to comply with its 
obligations, and future choices by the international community on how to respond to the 
threat which Iraq represented.

72.  Cabinet endorsed the conclusion that Iraq’s WMD programmes posed a threat to 
peace, and endorsed a strategy of engaging closely with the US Government in order to 
shape policy and its presentation. It did not discuss how that might be achieved.

73.  Mr Blair sought and was given information on a range of issues before his 
meeting with President Bush at Crawford on 5 and 6 April. But no formal and agreed 
analysis of the issues and options was sought or produced, and there was no collective 
consideration of such advice. 

74.  Mr Straw’s advice of 25 March proposed that the US and UK should seek an 
ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to re‑admit weapons inspectors.21 That would provide a 
route for the UK to align itself with the US without adopting the US objective of regime 
change. This reflected advice that regime change would be unlawful.

75.  At Crawford, Mr Blair offered President Bush a partnership in dealing urgently 
with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. He proposed that the UK and the US should 
pursue a strategy based on an ultimatum calling on Iraq to permit the return of weapons 
inspectors or face the consequences.22 

76.  President Bush agreed to consider the idea but there was no decision until 
September 2002.

77.  In the subsequent press conference on 6 April, Mr Blair stated that “doing nothing” 
was not an option: the threat of WMD was real and had to be dealt with.23 The lesson 
of 11 September was to ensure that “groups” were not allowed to develop a capability 
they might use.

78.  In his memoir, Mr Blair characterised the message that he and President Bush had 
delivered to Saddam Hussein as “change the regime attitude on WMD inspections or 
face the prospect of changing regime”.24

79.  Documents written between April and July 2002 reported that, in the discussion 
with President Bush at Crawford, Mr Blair had set out a number of considerations 
in relation to the development of policy on Iraq. These were variously described as:

*  The UN inspectors needed to be given every chance of success.
*  The US should take action within a multilateral framework with international 

support, not unilateral action.

quickly and successfully.

of Saddam Hussein’s regime and the threat he posed.

*  A public information campaign should be mounted to explain the nature 
*  Any military action would need to be within the framework of international law.
*  The military strategy would need to ensure Saddam Hussein could be removed 
*  A convincing “blueprint” was needed for a post‑Saddam Hussein Iraq which 
*  The US should advance the Middle East Peace Process in order to improve the 
chances of gaining broad support in the Middle East for military action against 
Iraq; and to pre‑empt accusations of double standards.

would be acceptable to both Iraq’s population and its neighbours. 

*  Action should enhance rather than diminish regional stability.
*  Success would be needed in Afghanistan to demonstrate the benefits of 

regime change. 

80.  Mr Blair considered that he was seeking to influence US policy by describing the key 
elements for a successful strategy to secure international support for any military action 
against Iraq.

81.  Key Ministers and some of their most senior advisers thought these were 
the conditions that would need to be met if the UK was to participate in US‑led 
military action.

82.  By July, no progress had been made on the ultimatum strategy and Iraq was still 
refusing to admit weapons inspectors as required by resolution 1284 (1999). 

83.  The UK Government was concerned that the US Administration was contemplating 
military action in circumstances where it would be very difficult for the UK to participate 
in or, conceivably, to support that action. 

84.  To provide the basis for a discussion with the US, a Cabinet Office paper of 19 July, 
‘Iraq: Conditions for Military Action’, identified the conditions which would be necessary 
before military action would be justified and the UK could participate in such action.25

85.  The Cabinet Office paper stated that Mr Blair had said at Crawford:

“... that the UK would support military action to bring about regime change, provided 
that certain conditions were met: 

*  efforts had been made to construct a coalition/shape public opinion,
*  the Israel‑Palestine Crisis was quiescent, and 
*  the options for action to eliminate Iraq’s WMD through the UN weapons 

inspectors had been exhausted.” 

25 Paper Cabinet Office, 19 July 2002, ‘Iraq: Conditions for Military Action’. 

86.  The Cabinet Office paper also identified the need to address the issue of whether 
the benefits of military action would outweigh the risks.

87.  The potential mismatch between the timetable and work programme for UNMOVIC 
stipulated in resolution 1284 (1999) and the US plans for military action was recognised 
by officials during the preparation of the Cabinet Office paper.26 

88.  The issue was not addressed in the final paper submitted to Ministers on 19 July.27 

89.  Sir Richard Dearlove reported that he had been told that the US had already taken 
a decision on action – “the question was only how and when”; and that he had been told 
it intended to set the threshold on weapons inspections so high that Iraq would not be 
able to hold up US policy.28

90.  Mr Blair’s meeting with Ministerial colleagues and senior officials on 23 July was 
not seen by those involved as having taken decisions.29 

91.  Further advice and background material were commissioned, including on the 
possibility of a UN ultimatum to Iraq and the legal basis for action. The record stated:

“We should work on the assumption that the UK would take part in any military 
action. But we needed a fuller picture of US planning before we could take any firm 
decisions. CDS [the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce] should 
tell the US military that we were considering a range of options.”

92.  Mr Blair was advised that there would be “formidable obstacles” to securing a new 
UN resolution incorporating an ultimatum without convincing evidence of a greatly 
increased threat from Iraq.30 A great deal more work would be needed to clarify what the 
UK was seeking and how its objective might best be achieved.

93.  Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush of 28 July sought to persuade President Bush to 
use the UN to build a coalition for action by seeking a partnership between the UK and 
the US and setting out a framework for action.31

94.  The Note began:

“I will be with you, whatever. But this is the moment to assess bluntly the difficulties. 
The planning on this and the strategy are the toughest yet. This is not Kosovo. 
This is not Afghanistan. It is not even the Gulf War.

“The military part of this is hazardous but I will concentrate mainly on the political 
context for success.” 

95.  Mr Blair stated that getting rid of Saddam Hussein was:

“... the right thing to do. He is a potential threat. He could be contained. 
But containment ... is always risky. His departure would free up the region. 
And his regime is ... brutal and inhumane ...”

96.  Mr Blair told President Bush that the UN was the simplest way to encapsulate a 
“casus belli” in some defining way, with an ultimatum to Iraq once military forces started 
to build up in October. That might be backed by a UN resolution.

97.  Mr Blair thought it unlikely that Saddam Hussein intended to allow inspectors to 
return. If he did, the JIC had advised that Iraq would obstruct the work of the inspectors. 
That could result in a material breach of the obligations imposed by the UN.

98.  A workable military plan to ensure the collapse of the regime would be required.

99.  The Note reflected Mr Blair’s own views. The proposals had not been discussed 
or agreed with his colleagues.

# Decision to take the UN route
100.  Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, told President Bush that it 
would be impossible for the UK to take part in any action against Iraq unless it went 
through the UN. 

101.  When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 31 July the “central issue of a casus 
belli” and the need for further work on the optimal route to achieve that was discussed.32 
Mr Blair said that he wanted to explore whether the UN was the right route to set an 
ultimatum or whether it would be an obstacle.

102.  In late August, the FCO proposed a strategy of coercion, using a UN resolution 
to issue an ultimatum to Iraq to admit the weapons inspectors and disarm. The UK 
was seeking a commitment from the Security Council to take action in the event that 
Saddam Hussein refused or subsequently obstructed the inspectors. 

103.  Reflecting the level of public debate and concern, Mr Blair decided in early 
September that an explanation of why action was needed to deal with Iraq should 
be published. 

32 Rycroft to McDonald, 31 July 2002, ‘Iraq: Prime Minister’s Phone Call with President Bush, 31 July’. 

104.  In his press conference at Sedgefield on 3 September, Mr Blair indicated that time 
and patience were running out and that there were difficulties with the existing policy of 
containment.33 He also announced the publication of the Iraq dossier, stating that: 

“... people will see that there is no doubt at all the United Nations resolutions that 
Saddam is in breach of are there for a purpose. He [Saddam Hussein] is without any 
question, still trying to develop that chemical, biological, potentially nuclear capability 
and to allow him to do so without any let or hindrance, just to say, we [sic] can carry 
on and do it, I think would be irresponsible.” 

105.  President Bush decided in the meeting of the National Security Council on 
7 September to take the issue of Iraq back to the UN. 

106.  The UK was a key ally whose support was highly desirable for the US. The US 
Administration had been left in no doubt that the UK Government needed the issue 
of Iraq to be taken back to the Security Council before it would be able to participate 
in military action in Iraq. 

107.  The objective of the subsequent discussions between President Bush and Mr Blair 
at Camp David was, as Mr Blair stated in the press conference before the discussions, 
to work out the strategy.34 

108.  Mr Blair told President Bush that he was in no doubt about the need to deal with 
Saddam Hussein.35 

109.  Although at that stage no decision had been taken on which military package might 
be offered to the US for planning purposes, Mr Blair also told President Bush that, if it 
came to war, the UK would take a significant military role. 

110.  In his speech to the General Assembly on 12 September, President Bush set out 
his view of the “grave and gathering danger” posed by Saddam Hussein and challenged 
the UN to act to address Iraq’s failure to meet the obligations imposed by the Security 
Council since 1990.36 He made clear that, if Iraq defied the UN, the world must hold 
Iraq to account and the US would “work with the UN Security Council for the necessary 
resolutions”. But the US would not stand by and do nothing in the face of the threat.

111.  Statements made by China, France and Russia in the General Assembly debate 
after President Bush’s speech highlighted the different positions of the five Permanent 
Members of the Security Council, in particular about the role of the Council in deciding 
whether military action was justified.

112.  The Government dossier on Iraq was published on 24 September.37 It was 
designed to “make the case” and secure Parliamentary (and public) support for the 
Government’s policy that action was urgently required to secure Iraq’s disarmament.

113.  In his statement to Parliament on 24 September and in his answers to subsequent 
questions, Mr Blair presented Iraq’s past, current and potential future capabilities as 
evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. 
He said that at some point in the future that threat would become a reality.38 

114.  Mr Blair wrote his statement to the House of Commons himself and chose the 
arguments to make clear his perception of the threat and why he believed that there 
was an “overwhelming” case for action to disarm Iraq.

115.  Addressing the question of why Saddam Hussein had decided in mid‑September, 
but not before, to admit the weapons inspectors, Mr Blair stated that the answer was in 
the dossier, and it was because:

“... his chemical, biological and nuclear programme is not an historic left‑over from 
1998. The inspectors are not needed to clean up the old remains. His weapons 
of mass destruction programme is active detailed and growing. The policy of 
containment is not working. The weapons of mass destruction programme is not 
shut down; it is up and running now.”

116.  Mr Blair posed, and addressed, three questions: “Why Saddam?”; “Why now?”; 
and “Why should Britain care?”

117.  On the question “Why Saddam?”, Mr Blair said that two things about Saddam 
Hussein stood out: “He had used these weapons in Iraq” and thousands had died, and 
he had used them during the war with Iran “in which one million people died”; and the 
regime had “no moderate elements to appeal to”.

118.  On the question “Why now?”, Mr Blair stated:

“I agree I cannot say that this month or next, even this year or next, Saddam will 
use his weapons. But I can say that if the international community, having made 
the call for his disarmament, now, at this moment, at the point of decision, shrugs 
its shoulders and walks away, he will draw the conclusion dictators faced with a 
weakening will always draw: that the international community will talk but not act, 
will use diplomacy but not force. We know, again from our history, that diplomacy 
not backed by the threat of force has never worked with dictators and never will.”

# Negotiation of resolution 1441
119.  There were significant differences between the US and UK positions, and between 
them and China, France and Russia about the substance of the strategy to be adopted, 
including the role of the Security Council in determining whether peaceful means had 
been exhausted and the use of force to secure disarmament was justified. 

120.  Those differences resulted in difficult negotiations over more than eight weeks 
before the unanimous adoption of resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002.

121.  When President Bush made his speech on 12 September, the US and UK had 
agreed the broad approach, but not the substance of the proposals to be put to the 
UN Security Council or the tactics. 

122.  Dr Naji Sabri, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, wrote to Mr Kofi Annan, the 
UN Secretary‑General, on 16 September to inform him that, following the series of talks 
between Iraq and the UN in New York and Vienna between March and July 2002 and the 
latest round in New York on 14 and 15 September, Iraq had decided “to allow the return 
of United Nations inspectors to Iraq without conditions”.39 

123.  The US and UK immediately expressed scepticism. They had agreed that the 
provisions of resolution 1284 (1999) were no longer sufficient to secure the disarmament 
of Iraq and a strengthened inspections regime would be required. 

124.  A new resolution would be needed both to maintain the pressure on Iraq and to 
define a more intrusive inspections regime allowing the inspectors unconditional and 
unrestricted access to all Iraqi facilities. 

125.  The UK’s stated objective for the negotiation of resolution 1441 was to 
give Saddam Hussein “one final chance to comply” with his obligations to disarm. 
The UK initially formulated the objective in terms of: 

*  a resolution setting out an ultimatum to Iraq to re‑admit the UN weapons 
*  a threat to resort to the use of force to secure disarmament if Iraq failed 

inspectors and to disarm in accordance with its obligations; and

to comply.40

126.  Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, informed Mr Blair on 22 October that, 
although he would not be able to give a final view until the resolution was adopted, the 
draft of the resolution of 19 October would not on its own authorise military action.41

Affairs of Iraq addressed to the Secretary‑General’, attached to ‘Letter dated 16 September from the

attaching Briefing, ‘Lines to take’.


127.  Mr Blair decided on 31 October to offer significant forces for ground operations 
to the US for planning purposes.42

128.  During the negotiations, France and Russia made clear their opposition to the use 
of force, without firm evidence of a further material breach and a further decision in the 
Security Council. 

129.  The UK was successful in changing some aspects of the US position during the 
negotiations, in particular ensuring that the Security Council resolution was based on 
the disarmament of Iraq rather than wider issues as originally proposed by the US. 

130.  To secure consensus in the Security Council despite the different positions of the 
US and France and Russia (described by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Permanent 
Representative to the UN in New York, as “irreconcilable”), resolution 1441 was a 
compromise containing drafting “fixes”. That created deliberate ambiguities on a number 
of key issues including: 

a material breach;

*  the level of non‑compliance with resolution 1441 which would constitute 
*  by whom that determination would be made; and 
*  whether there would be a second resolution explicitly authorising the use 

of force. 

131.  As the Explanations of Vote demonstrated, there were significant differences 
between the positions of the members of the Security Council about the circumstances 
and timing of recourse to military action. There were also differences about whether 
Member States should be entitled to report Iraqi non‑compliance to the Council. 

132.  Mr Blair, Mr Straw and other senior UK participants in the negotiation of resolution 
1441 envisaged that, in the event of a material breach of Iraq’s obligations, a second 
resolution determining that a breach existed and authorising the use of force was likely 
to be tabled in the Security Council. 

133.  Iraq announced on 13 November that it would comply with resolution 1441.43

134.  Iraq also restated its position that it had neither produced nor was in possession 
of weapons of mass destruction since the inspectors left in December 1998. It explicitly 
challenged the UK statement on 8 November that Iraq had “decided to keep possession” 
of its WMD.

# The prospect of military action
135.  Following Iraq’s submission of the declaration on its chemical, biological, nuclear 
and ballistic missile programmes to the UN on 7 December, and before the inspectors 
had properly begun their task, the US concluded that Saddam Hussein was not going 
to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 to comply with his obligations.

136.  Mr Blair was advised on 11 December that there was impatience in the US 
Administration and it was looking at military action as early as mid‑February 2003.44

137.  Mr Blair told President Bush on 16 December that the Iraqi declaration was 
“patently false”.45 He was “cautiously optimistic” that the inspectors would find proof. 

138.  In a statement issued on 18 December, Mr Straw said that Saddam Hussein had 
decided to continue the pretence that Iraq had no WMD programme. If he persisted 
“in this obvious falsehood” it would become clear that he had “rejected the pathway 
to peace”.46

139.  The JIC’s initial Assessment of the Iraqi declaration on 18 December stated 
that there had been “No serious attempt” to answer any of the unresolved questions 
highlighted by the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) or to refute any of the points 
made in the UK dossier on Iraq’s WMD programme.47

140.  President Bush is reported to have told a meeting of the US National Security 
Council on 18 December 2002, at which the US response to Iraq’s declaration 
was discussed, that the point of the 7 December declaration was to test whether 
Saddam Hussein would accept the “final opportunity” for peace offered by the Security 
Council.48 He had summed up the discussion by stating:

“We’ve got what we need now, to show America that Saddam won’t disarm himself.”

141.  Mr Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, stated on 19 December that Iraq was 
“well on its way to losing its last chance”, and that there was a “practical limit” to how 
long the inspectors could be given to complete their work.49

142.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell on 30 December that the US and UK should 
develop a clear “plan B” postponing military action on the basis that inspections plus 
the threat of force were containing Saddam Hussein.50

143.  In early 2003, Mr Straw still thought a peaceful solution was more likely than 
military action. Mr Straw advised Mr Blair on 3 January that he had concluded that, in 
the potential absence of a “smoking gun”, there was a need to consider a “Plan B”.51 The 
UK should emphasise to the US that the preferred strategy was peaceful disarmament. 

144.  Mr Blair took a different view. By the time he returned to the office on 4 January 
2003, he had concluded that the “likelihood was war” and, if conflict could not be 
avoided, the right thing to do was fully to support the US.52 He was focused on the 
need to establish evidence of an Iraqi breach, to persuade opinion of the case for 
action and to finalise the strategy with President Bush at the end of January.

145.  The UK objectives were published in a Written Ministerial Statement by Mr Straw 
on 7 January.53 The “prime objective” was:

“... to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their associated 
programmes and means of delivery, including prohibited ballistic missiles ... as set 
out in UNSCRs [UN Security Council resolutions]. This would reduce Iraq’s ability 
to threaten its neighbours and the region, and prevent Iraq using WMD against its 
own people. UNSCRs also require Iraq to renounce terrorism, and return captured 
Kuwaitis and property taken from Kuwait.” 

146.  Lord Goldsmith gave Mr Blair his draft advice on 14 January that resolution 1441 
would not by itself authorise the use of military force.54 

147.  Mr Blair agreed on 17 January to deploy a UK division with three combat brigades 
for possible operations in southern Iraq.55

148.  There was no collective discussion of the decision by senior Ministers.

149.  In January 2003, there was a clear divergence between the UK and US 
Government positions over the timetable for military action, and the UK became 
increasingly concerned that US impatience with the inspections process would lead 
to a decision to take unilateral military action in the absence of support for such action 
in the Security Council. 

150.  On 23 January, Mr Blair was advised that the US military would be ready for action 
in mid‑February.56 

151.  In a Note to President Bush on 24 January, Mr Blair wrote that the arguments 
for proceeding with a second Security Council resolution, “or at the very least a

clear statement” from Dr Blix which allowed the US and UK to argue that a failure 
to pass a second resolution was in breach of the spirit of 1441, remained in his view, 
overwhelming; and that inspectors should be given until the end of March or early April 
to carry out their task.57

152.  Mr Blair suggested that, in the absence of a “smoking gun”, Dr Blix would be able 
to harden up his findings on the basis of a pattern of non‑co‑operation from Iraq and that 
that would be sufficient for support for military action in the Security Council. 

153.  The US and UK should seek to persuade others, including Dr Blix, that that was 
the “true view” of resolution 1441. 

154.  Mr Blair used an interview on Breakfast with Frost on 26 January to set out the 
position that the inspections should be given sufficient time to determine whether or 
not Saddam Hussein was co‑operating fully.58 If he was not, that would be a sufficient 
reason for military action. A find of WMD was not required.

155.  Mr Blair’s proposed approach to his meeting with President Bush was discussed 
in a meeting of Ministers before Cabinet on 30 January and then discussed in general 
terms in Cabinet itself. 

156.  In a Note prepared before his meeting with President Bush on 31 January, Mr Blair 
proposed seeking a UN resolution on 5 March followed by an attempt to “mobilise Arab 
opinion to try to force Saddam out” before military action on 15 March.59

157.  When Mr Blair met President Bush on 31 January, it was clear that the window of 
opportunity before the US took military action would be very short. The military campaign 
could begin “around 10 March”.60

158.  President Bush agreed to seek a second resolution to help Mr Blair, but there were 
major reservations within the US Administration about the wisdom of that approach. 

159.  Mr Blair confirmed that he was “solidly with the President and ready to do whatever 
it took to disarm Saddam” Hussein. 

160.  Reporting on his visit to Washington, Mr Blair told Parliament on 3 February 2003 
that Saddam Hussein was not co‑operating as required by resolution 1441 and, if that 
continued, a second resolution should be passed to confirm such a material breach.61

161.  Mr Blair continued to set the need for action against Iraq in the context of the need 
to be seen to enforce the will of the UN and to deter future threats.

# The gap between the Permanent Members of the Security Council widens
162.  In their reports to the Security Council on 14 February:

*  Dr Blix reported that UNMOVIC had not found any weapons of mass destruction 

and the items that were not accounted for might not exist, but Iraq needed to 
provide the evidence to answer the questions, not belittle them.

*  Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy 

Agency (IAEA), reported that the IAEA had found no evidence of ongoing 
prohibited nuclear or nuclear‑related activities in Iraq although a number 
of issues were still under investigation.62

163.  In the subsequent debate, members of the Security Council voiced widely 
divergent views.

164.  Mr Annan concluded that there were real differences on strategy and timing in 
the Security Council. Iraq’s non‑co‑operation was insufficient to bring members to agree 
that war was justified; they would only move if they came to their own judgement that 
inspections were pointless.63

165.  On 19 February, Mr Blair sent President Bush a six‑page Note. He proposed 
focusing on the absence of full co‑operation and a “simple” resolution stating that Iraq 
had failed to take the final opportunity, with a side statement defining tough tests of 
co‑operation and a vote on 14 March to provide a deadline for action.64

166.  President Bush and Mr Blair agreed to introduce a draft resolution at the UN the 
following week but its terms were subject to further discussion.65 

167.  On 20 February, Mr Blair told Dr Blix that he wanted to offer the US an alternative 
strategy which included a deadline and tests for compliance.66 He did not think Saddam 
Hussein would co‑operate but he would try to get Dr Blix as much time as possible. Iraq 
could have signalled a change of heart in the December declaration. The Americans did 
not think that Saddam was going to co‑operate: “Nor did he. But we needed to keep the 
international community together.” 

168.  Dr Blix stated that full co‑operation was a nebulous concept; and a deadline of 
15 April would be too early. Dr Blix commented that “perhaps there was not much WMD 
in Iraq after all”. Mr Blair responded that “even German and French intelligence were 
sure that there was WMD in Iraq”. Dr Blix said they seemed “unsure” about “mobile BW

production facilities”: “It would be paradoxical and absurd if 250,000 men were to invade 
Iraq and find very little.” 

169.  Mr Blair responded that “our intelligence was clear that Saddam had reconstituted 
his WMD programme”.

170.  On 24 February, the UK, US and Spain tabled a draft resolution stating that Iraq 
had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 and that the Security 
Council had decided to remain seized of the matter.67 The draft failed to attract support.

171.  France, Germany and Russia responded by tabling a memorandum, building on 
their tripartite declaration of 10 February, stating that “full and effective disarmament” 
remained “the imperative objective of the international community”.68 That “should be 
achieved peacefully through the inspection regime”. The “conditions for using force” had 
“not been fulfilled”. The Security Council “must step up its efforts to give a real chance 
to the peaceful settlement of the crisis”. 

172.  On 25 February, Mr Blair told the House of Commons that the intelligence was 
“clear” that Saddam Hussein continued “to believe that his weapons of mass destruction 
programme is essential both for internal repression and for external aggression”.69 
It was also “essential to his regional power”. “Prior to the inspectors coming back in”, 
Saddam Hussein “was engaged in a systematic exercise in concealment of those 
weapons”. The inspectors had reported some co‑operation on process, but had 
“denied progress on substance”. 

173.  The House of Commons was asked on 26 February to reaffirm its endorsement of 
resolution 1441, support the Government’s continuing efforts to disarm Iraq, and to call 
upon Iraq to recognise that this was its final opportunity to comply with its obligations.70

174.  The Government motion was approved by 434 votes to 124; 199 MPs voted for 
an amendment which invited the House to “find the case for military action against Iraq 
as yet unproven”.71

175.  In a speech on 26 February, President Bush stated that the safety of the American 
people depended on ending the direct and growing threat from Iraq.72

176.  President Bush also set out his hopes for the future of Iraq.

177.  Reporting discussions in New York on 26 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote 
that there was “a general antipathy to having now to take decisions on this issue, and 
a wariness about what our underlying motives are behind the resolution”.73 Sir Jeremy 
concluded that the US was focused on preserving its room for manoeuvre while he 
was “concentrating on trying to win votes”. It was the “middle ground” that mattered. 
Mexico and Chile were the “pivotal sceptics”. 

178.  Lord Goldsmith told No.10 officials on 27 February that the safest legal course for 
future military action would be to secure a further Security Council resolution.74 He had, 
however, reached the view that a “reasonable case” could be made that resolution 1441 
was capable of reviving the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 (1990) without a 
further resolution, if there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed 
to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441.

179.  Lord Goldsmith advised that, to avoid undermining the case for reliance on 
resolution 1441, it would be important to avoid giving any impression that the UK 
believed a second resolution was legally required. 

180.  Informal consultations in the Security Council on 27 February showed there was 
little support for the UK/US/Spanish draft resolution.75 

181.  An Arab League Summit on 1 March concluded that the crisis in Iraq must be 
resolved by peaceful means and in the framework of international legitimacy.76

182.  Following his visit to Mexico, Sir David Manning concluded that Mexican support 
for a second resolution was “not impossible, but would not be easy and would almost 
certainly require some movement”.77 

183.  During Sir David’s visit to Chile, President Ricardo Lagos repeated his concerns, 
including the difficulty of securing nine votes or winning the presentational battle 
without further clarification of Iraq’s non‑compliance. He also suggested identifying 
benchmarks.78

184.  Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that, during February, “despite his best endeavours”, 
divisions in the Security Council had grown not reduced; and that the “dynamics of 
disagreement” were producing new alliances.79 France, Germany and Russia were 
moving to create an alternative pole of power and influence.

185.  Mr Blair thought that was “highly damaging” but “inevitable”: “They felt as strongly 
as I did; and they weren’t prepared to indulge the US, as they saw it.”

186.  Mr Blair concluded that for moral and strategic reasons the UK should be with 
the US and that:

“... [W]e should make a last ditch attempt for a peaceful solution. First to make 
the moral case for removing Saddam ... Second, to try one more time to reunite 
the international community behind a clear base for action in the event of a 
continuing breach.” 

187.  On 3 March, Mr Blair proposed an approach focused on setting a deadline of 
17 March for Iraq to disclose evidence relating to the destruction of prohibited items 
and permit interviews; and an amnesty if Saddam Hussein left Iraq by 21 March.80

188.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that the level of support in the UK for military action 
without a second resolution was palpably “very low”. In that circumstance, even if a 
majority in the Security Council had voted for the resolution with only France exercising 
its veto, he was “increasingly pessimistic” about support within the Labour Party for 
military action.81 The debate in the UK was: 

“... significantly defined by the tone of the debate in Washington and particularly 
remarks made by the President and others to the right of him, which suggested that 
the US would go to war whatever and was not bothered about a second resolution 
one way or another.” 

189.  Following a discussion with Mr Blair, Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that Mr Blair:

“... was concerned that, having shifted world (and British) public opinion over the 
months, it had now been seriously set back in recent days. We were not in the right 
position. The Prime Minister was considering a number of ideas which he might well 
put to the President.”82 

190.  Mr Straw recorded that Secretary Powell had advised that, if Mr Blair wanted 
to make proposals, he should do so quickly. The US was not enthusiastic about the 
inclusion of an immunity clause for Saddam Hussein in the resolution.

191.  Mr Straw reported that Secretary Powell had told President Bush that he judged 
a vetoed resolution would no longer be possible for the UK. Mr Straw said that without 
a second resolution approval for military action could be “beyond reach”.

82 Letter Straw to Manning, 4 March 2003, ‘Iraq: Conversation with Colin Powell, 3 March’. 


192.  Mr Straw told the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) on 4 March that it was “a matter 
of fact” that Iraq had been in material breach “for some weeks” and resolution 1441 
provided sufficient legal authority to justify military action against Iraq if it was “in further 
material breach”.83

193.  Mr Straw also stated that a majority of members of the Security Council had been 
opposed to the suggestion that resolution 1441 should state explicitly that military action 
could be taken only if there were a second resolution.

194.  Mr Blair was informed on the evening of 4 March that US military planners were 
looking at 12 March as the possible start date for the military campaign; and that 
Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, was concerned about the apparent disconnect 
with activity in the UN.84

195.  Baroness Amos, Minister of State, Department for International Development 
(DFID), advised on 4 March that Angola, Cameroon and Guinea were not yet ready 
to commit to a “yes vote” and had emphasised the need for P5 unity.85

196.  Sir Christopher Hum, British Ambassador to China, advised on 4 March that, 
if the resolution was put to a vote that day, China would abstain.86

197.  Sir John Holmes, British Ambassador to France, advised on 4 March that 
France’s main aim was to “avoid being put on the spot” by influencing the undecided, 
preventing the US and UK mustering nine votes, and keeping alongside the Russians 
and Chinese; and that there was “nothing that we can now do to dissuade them from 
this course”.87 Sir John also advised that “nothing the French say at this stage, even 
privately, should be taken at face value”. 

198.  Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, told Mr Straw on 4 March that Russia 
had failed in an attempt to persuade Saddam Hussein to leave and it would veto a 
resolution based on the draft circulated on 24 February.88 

199.  France, Germany and Russia stated on 5 March that they would not let a resolution 
pass that authorised the use of force.89 Russia and France, “as Permanent Members of 
the Security Council, will assume all their responsibilities on this point”.

200.  The British Embassy Washington reported overnight on 5/6 March that “barring 
a highly improbable volte face by Saddam”, the US was now firmly on track for military 
action and would deal firmly with any efforts in the UN to slow down the timetable.90 

201.  The Embassy reported that the only event which might significantly affect the US 
timetable would be problems for the UK. That had been described as “huge – like trying 
to play football without the quarterback”. The US was “therefore pulling out all the stops 
at the UN”. The US fully understood the importance of the second resolution for the UK. 

202.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the US would not countenance the use of 
benchmarks. That risked delaying the military timetable.91

203.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 6 March that the argument boiled down to the question of 
whether Saddam Hussein would ever voluntarily co‑operate with the UN to disarm Iraq.92

204.  Mr Blair concluded that it was for the Security Council to determine whether Iraq 
was co‑operating fully.

205.  In his discussions with President Lagos on 6 March, Mr Blair stated that the US 
would go ahead without the UN if asked to delay military action until April or May.93 

206.  In his report to the Security Council on 7 March, Dr Blix stated that there had 
been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq since the end of January, but they could 
not be said to constitute immediate co‑operation.94 Nor did they necessarily cover all 
areas of relevance; but they were nevertheless welcome. UNMOVIC was drawing up a 
work programme of key disarmament tasks, which would be ready later that month, for 
approval by the Security Council. It would take “months” to complete the programme.

207.  Dr ElBaradei reported that there were no indications that Iraq had resumed nuclear 
activities since the inspectors left in December 1998 and the recently increased level 
of Iraqi co‑operation should allow the IAEA to provide the Security Council with an 
assessment of Iraq’s nuclear capabilities in the near future. 

208.  There was unanimity in calls for Iraq to increase its co‑operation. But there was a 
clear division between the US, UK, Spain and Bulgaria who spoke in favour of a further 
resolution and France, Germany, Russia and China and most other Member States 
who spoke in favour of continuing to pursuing disarmament through strengthened 
inspections. 

209.  The UK, US and Spain circulated a revised draft resolution deciding that Iraq 
would have failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 (2002) unless

the Council concluded, on or before 17 March 2003, that Iraq had demonstrated full, 
unconditional, immediate and active co‑operation in accordance with its disarmament 
obligations and was yielding possession of all weapons and proscribed material to 
UNMOVIC and the IAEA. 

210.  President Putin told Mr Blair on 7 March that Russia would oppose military action.95

211.  Mr Straw told Mr Annan that military considerations could not be allowed “to dictate 
policy”, but the military build‑up “could not be maintained for ever”, and:

“... the more he had looked into the Iraq dossier [issue] the more convinced he 
had become of the need for action. Reading the clusters document [a report 
of outstanding issues produced by UNMOVIC on 7 March] made his hair stand 
on end.”96

212.  Mr Straw set out the UK thinking on a deadline, stating that this was “Iraq’s last 
chance”, but the objective was disarmament and, if Saddam Hussein did what was 
demanded, “he could stay”. In those circumstances, a “permanent and toughened 
inspections regime” would be needed, possibly “picking up some earlier ideas for 
an all‑Iraq NFZ”. 

213.  Lord Goldsmith sent his formal advice to Mr Blair on 7 March.97

# The end of the UN route
214.  When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush at 6pm on 7 March he emphasised the 
importance of securing nine positive votes98 in the Security Council for Parliamentary 
approval for UK military action.99

215.  Mr Blair argued that while the 17 March deadline in the draft resolution was not 
sufficient for Iraq to disarm fully, it was sufficient to make a judgement on whether 
Saddam Hussein had had a change of heart. If Iraq started to co‑operate, the inspectors 
could have as much time as they liked. 

216.  In a last attempt to move opinion and secure the support of nine members of 
the Security Council, Mr Blair decided on 8 March to propose a short extension of 
the timetable beyond 17 March and to revive the idea of producing a “side statement” 
setting out a series of tests which would provide the basis for a judgement on 
Saddam Hussein’s intentions.

217.  The initiative was pursued through intensive diplomatic activity to lobby for support 
between London and the capitals of Security Council Member States. 

218.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry:

“It was worth having one last‑ditch chance to see if you could bring people back 
together on the same page ... [W]hat President Bush had to do was agree to 
table a fresh resolution. What the French had to agree was you couldn’t have 
another resolution and another breach and no action. So my idea was define the 
circumstances of breach – that was the tests that we applied with Hans Blix – get 
the Americans to agree to the resolution, get the French to agree that you couldn’t 
just go back to the same words of 1441 again, you had to take it a stage further.”100 

219.  In a discussion on 9 March, Mr Blair told President Bush that he needed a second 
resolution to secure Parliamentary support for UK involvement in military action.101 
He sought President Bush’s support for setting out tests in a side statement, including 
that the vote in the Security Council might have to be delayed “by a couple of days”. 

220.  President Bush was unwilling to countenance delay. He was reported to have told 
Mr Blair that, if the second resolution failed, he would find another way to involve the UK.

221.  Mr Blair told President Bush the UK would be with the US in taking action if he 
(Mr Blair) possibly could be.

222.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Dr Blix was prepared to work with the UK 
on identifying tests but had reminded him that UNMOVIC still lacked clear evidence that 
Iraq possessed any WMD.102

223.  Mr Blair spoke twice to President Lagos on 10 March in an attempt to find a path 
that President Lagos and President Vicente Fox of Mexico could support. 

224.  In the second conversation, Mr Blair said that he thought it “would be possible to find 
different wording” on the ultimatum to Iraq. Timing “would be difficult, but he would try 
to get some flexibility” if the first two issues “fell into place”.103

225.  Mr Straw reported that Secretary Powell thought that there were seven solid votes, 
and uncertainty about Mexico, Chile and Pakistan.104 If there were fewer than nine, the 
second resolution should not be put to the vote.

226.  Mr Straw replied that “he was increasingly coming to the view that we should not 
push the matter to a vote if we were going to be vetoed”; but that had not yet been 
agreed by Mr Blair. 

227.  By 10 March, President Bush’s position was hardening and he was very reluctant 
to delay military action.

228.  When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush, they discussed the “seven solid votes” 
for the resolution.105

229.  Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, 
wrote that Mr Blair had done most of the talking.106 President Bush thought 
President Jacques Chirac of France was “trying to get us to the stage where we would 
not put [the resolution] to a vote because we would be so worried about losing”. 

230.  Mr Blair had argued that if Chile and Mexico could be shifted, that would “change 
the weather”. If France and Russia then vetoed the resolution but the “numbers were 
right on the UN”, Mr Blair thought that he would “have a fighting chance of getting it 
through the Commons”. Subsequently, Mr Blair suggested that a change in Chile and 
Mexico’s position might be used to influence President Putin. 

231.  President Bush was “worried about rolling in more time” but Mr Blair had “held his 
ground”, arguing that Chile and Mexico would “need to be able to point to something that 
they won last minute that explains why they finally supported us”. President Bush “said 
‘Let me be frank. The second resolution is for the benefit of Great Britain. We would 
want it so we can go ahead together.’” President Bush’s position was that the US and 
UK “must not retreat from 1441 and we cannot keep giving them more time”; it was “time 
to do this” and there should be “no more deals”.

232.  Sir David Manning sent the UK proposals for a revised deadline, and a side 
statement identifying six tests on which Saddam Hussein’s intentions would be 
judged, to Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National Security Advisor, and to 
President Lagos.107

233.  Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that President Bush and his military were concerned 
about delay.108 

“It [the proposal for tests/more time] was indeed a hard sell to George. His system 
was completely against it. His military were, not unreasonably, fearing that delay 
gave the enemy time – and time could mean a tougher struggle and more lives lost.

108 Blair T. A Journey. Hutchinson, 2010. 

This was also troubling my military. We had all sorts of contingency plans in place ... 
There was both UK and US intelligence warning us of the risk.

“Nonetheless I thought it was worth a try ...”

234.  Mr Blair also wrote:

“Chile and Mexico were prepared to go along, but only up to a point. Ricardo made 
it clear that if there was heavy opposition from France, it would be tough for them to 
participate in what would then be a token vote, incapable of being passed because 
of a veto – and what’s more, a veto not by Russia, but by France.

“Unfortunately, the French position had, if anything, got harder not softer. They were 
starting to say they would not support military action in any circumstances, 
irrespective of what the inspectors found ...”

235.  In a press conference on 10 March, Mr Annan reiterated the Security Council’s 
determination to disarm Iraq, but said that every avenue for a peaceful resolution of the 
crisis had to be exhausted before force should be used.109

236.  Mr Annan also warned that, if the Security Council failed to agree on a common 
position and action was taken without the authority of the Council, the legitimacy and 
support for any such action would be seriously impaired. 

237.  In an interview on 10 March, President Chirac stated that it was for the inspectors 
to advise whether they could complete their task.110 If they reported that they were not 
in a position to guarantee Iraq’s disarmament, it would be:

“... for the Security Council alone to decide the right thing to do. But in that case ... 
regrettably, the war would become inevitable. It isn’t today.” 

238.  President Chirac stated that he did not consider that the draft resolution tabled by 
the US, UK and Spain would attract support from nine members of the Security Council. 
In that case, there would be no majority for action, “So there won’t be a veto problem.”

239.  But if there were a majority “in favour of the new resolution”, France would 
“vote ‘no’”.

240.  In response to a question asking, “And, this evening, this is your position in 
principle?”, President Chirac responded:

“My position is that, regardless of the circumstances, France will vote ‘no’ because 
she considers this evening that there are no grounds for waging war in order to 
achieve the goal we have set ourselves, that is to disarm Iraq.”

produced in a Note, [unattributed and undated], ‘Iraq – Interview given by M. Jacques Chirac, President  
of the Republic, to French TV (10 March 2003)’.


241.  By 11 March, it was clear that, in the time available before the US was going to 
take military action, it would be difficult to secure nine votes in the Security Council 
for a resolution determining that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by 
resolution 1441.

242.  Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 11 March setting out his firm conclusion that: 

“If we cannot gain nine votes and be sure of no veto, we should not push our 
second resolution to a vote. The political and diplomatic consequences for the UK 
would be significantly worse to have our ... resolution defeated ... than if we camp 
on 1441 ...”111 

243.  Mr Straw set out his reasoning in some detail, including that:

*  Although in earlier discussion he had “warmed to the idea” that it was worth 

pushing the issue to a vote “if we had nine votes and faced only a French veto”, 
the more he “thought about this, the worse an idea it becomes”.

*  A veto by France only was “in practice less likely than two or even three vetoes”. 
*  The “best, least risky way to gain a moral majority” was “by the ‘Kosovo route’ – 
essentially what I am recommending. The key to our moral legitimacy then was 
the matter never went to a vote – but everyone knew the reason for this was that 
Russia would have vetoed.” 

244.  Mr Straw suggested that the UK should adopt a strategy based on the argument 
that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441, and that the 
last three meetings of the Security Council met the requirement for Security Council 
consideration of reports of non‑compliance. 

245.  Mr Straw also identified the need for a “Plan B” for the UK not to participate 
in military action in the event that the Government failed to secure a majority in the 
Parliamentary Labour Party for military action.

246.  Mr Straw concluded:

“We will obviously need to discuss all this, but I thought it best to put it in your mind 
as event[s] could move fast. And what I propose is a great deal better than the 
alternatives. When Bush graciously accepted your offer to be with him all the way, 
he wanted you alive not dead!”

247.  There was no reference in the minute to President Chirac’s remarks the 
previous evening.

111 Minute Straw to Prime Minister, 11 March 2003, ‘Iraq: What if We Cannot Win the Second Resolution?’ 

248.  When Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the position late on 11 March, it was 
clear that President Bush was determined not to postpone the start of military action.112 
They discussed the impact of President Chirac’s “veto threats”. Mr Blair considered that 
President Chirac’s remarks “gave some cover” for ending the UN route.

249.  Reporting discussions in New York on 11 March on the draft resolution and details 
of a possible “side statement”, Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the draft resolution 
tabled by the UK, US and Spain on 7 March had “no chance ... of adoption”.113 

250.  In a telephone call with President Bush on 12 March, Mr Blair proposed that the 
US and UK should continue to seek a compromise in the UN, while confirming that he 
knew it would not happen. He would say publicly that the French had prevented them 
from securing a resolution, so there would not be one.114

251.  Mr Blair wanted to avoid a gap between the end of the negotiating process and 
the Parliamentary vote in which France or another member of the Security Council might 
table a resolution that attracted the support of a majority of the Council. That could have 
undermined the UK (and US) position on its legal basis for action.

252.  When he discussed the options with Mr Straw early on 12 March, Mr Blair decided 
that the UK would continue to support the US.115

253.  During Prime Minister’s Questions on 12 March, Mr Blair stated:

“I hope that even now those countries that are saying they would use their veto no 
matter what the circumstances will reconsider and realise that by doing so they put 
at risk not just the disarmament of Saddam, but the unity of the United Nations.”116 

254.  The FCO assessed on 12 March that the votes of the three African states were 
reasonably secure but Pakistan’s vote was not so certain. It was hoped that the six tests 
plus a short extension of the 17 March deadline might deliver Mexico and Chile.117 

255.  The UK circulated its draft side statement setting out the six tests to a meeting 
of Security Council members in New York on the evening of 12 March.118 

256.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Council members that the UK “non‑paper” responded 
to an approach from the “undecided six”119 looking for a way forward, setting out six

tasks to be achieved in a 10‑day timeline.120 Sir Jeremy reported that France, Germany 
and Russia all said that the draft resolution without operative paragraph 3 would still 
authorise force. The UK had not achieved “any kind of breakthrough” and there were 
“serious questions about the available time”, which the US would “not help us to satisfy”.

257.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 13 March that work continued in the UN to obtain a second 
resolution and, following the French decision to veto, the outcome remained open.121

258.  Mr Straw described President Chirac’s position as “irresponsible”.

259.  Mr Straw told Cabinet that there was “good progress” in gaining support in the 
Security Council. 

260.  Mr Blair concluded that the French position “looked to be based on a calculation 
of strategic benefit”. It was “in contradiction of the Security Council’s earlier view that 
military action would follow if Iraq did not fully and unconditionally co‑operate with the 
inspectors”. The UK would “continue to show flexibility” in its efforts to achieve a second 
resolution and, “if France could be shown to be intransigent, the mood of the Security 
Council could change towards support for the British draft”. 

261.  Mr Blair agreed the military plan later on 13 March.122

262.  On 13 March, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed withdrawing the resolution 
on 17 March followed by a US ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to leave within 48 hours. 
There would be no US military action until after the vote in the House of Commons on 
18 March.123

263.  Mr Blair continued to press President Bush to publish the Road Map on the Middle 
East Peace Process because of its impact on domestic opinion in the UK as well as its 
strategic impact.

264.  Reporting developments in New York on 13 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock warned 
that the UK tests had attracted no support, and that the US might be ready to call a halt 
to the UN process on 15 March.124 The main objections had included the “perceived 
authorisation of force in the draft resolution” and a desire to wait for UNMOVIC’s own list 
of key tasks which would be issued early the following week. 

265.  President Chirac told Mr Blair on 14 March that France was “content to proceed 
‘in the logic of UNSCR 1441’; but it could not accept an ultimatum or any ‘automaticity’ 
of recourse to force”.125 He proposed looking at a new resolution in line with

resolution 1441, “provided that it excluded these options”. President Chirac “suggested 
that the UNMOVIC work programme might provide a way forward. France was prepared 
to look at reducing the 120 day timeframe it envisaged.” 

266.  In response to a question from President Chirac about whether it would be the 
inspectors or the Security Council who decided whether Saddam had co‑operated, 
Mr Blair “insisted that it must be the Security Council”. 

267.  President Chirac agreed, “although the Security Council should make its 
judgement on the basis of the inspectors’ report”. He “wondered whether it would be 
worth” Mr Straw and Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign Minister, “discussing 
the situation to see if we could find some flexibility”; or was it “too late”?

268.  Mr Blair said, “every avenue must be explored”. 

269.  In the subsequent conversation with President Bush about the French position and 
what to say when the resolution was pulled, Mr Blair proposed that they would need to 
show that France would not authorise the use of force in any circumstances.126

270.  President Lagos initially informed Mr Blair on 14 March that the UK proposals did 
not have Chile’s support and that he was working on other ideas.127 He subsequently 
informed Mr Blair that he would not pursue his proposals unless Mr Blair or President 
Bush asked him to.

271.  Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires, British Embassy Washington, reported that 
President Bush was determined to remove Saddam Hussein and to stick to the US 
timetable for action. The UK’s “steadfastness” had been “invaluable” in bringing in other 
countries in support of action.128

272.  In a declaration on 15 March, France, with Germany and Russia, attempted 
to secure support in the Security Council for continued inspections.129

273.  At the Azores Summit on 16 March, President Bush, Mr Blair and Prime Minister 
José María Aznar of Spain agreed that, unless there was a fundamental change in the 
next 24 hours, the UN process would end.130

274.  In public, the focus was on a “last chance for peace”. The joint communiqué 
contained a final appeal to Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations and to 
the Security Council to back a second resolution containing an ultimatum.

275.  In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote:

“So when I look back ... I know there was never any way Britain was not going to 
be with the US at that moment, once we went down the UN route and Saddam was 
in breach. Of course such a statement is always subject to in extremis correction. 
A crazy act of aggression? No, we would not have supported that. But given the 
history, you couldn’t call Saddam a crazy target.

“Personally I have little doubt that at some point we would have to have dealt 
with him ...”131

276.  At “about 3.15pm UK time” on 17 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock announced that 
the resolution would not be put to a vote, stating that the co‑sponsors reserved the right 
to take their own steps to secure the disarmament of Iraq.132 

277.  The subsequent discussion in the Council suggested that only the UK, the US, 
and Spain took the view that all options other than the use of military force had been 
exhausted.133

278.  A specially convened Cabinet at 1600 on 17 March 2003 endorsed the decision 
that the diplomatic process was now at an end and Saddam Hussein should be given 
an ultimatum to leave Iraq; and that the House of Commons would be asked to endorse 
the use of military action against Iraq to enforce compliance, if necessary.134

279.  In his statement to the House of Commons that evening, Mr Straw said that the 
Government had reluctantly concluded that France’s actions had put a consensus in 
the Security Council on a further resolution “beyond reach”.135

280.  As a result of Saddam Hussein’s persistent refusal to meet the UN’s demands, 
the Cabinet had decided to ask the House of Commons to support the UK’s participation 
in military action, should that be necessary to achieve the disarmament of Iraq “and 
thereby the maintenance of the authority of the United Nations”. 

281.  Mr Straw stated that Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer “set out the legal basis 
for the use of force”.

282.  Mr Straw drew attention to the significance of the fact that no one “in discussions 
in the Security Council and outside” had claimed that Iraq was in full compliance with 
its obligations. 

283.  In a statement later that evening, Mr Robin Cook, the Leader of the House of 
Commons, set out his doubts about the degree to which Saddam Hussein posed a

“clear and present danger” and his concerns that the UK was being “pushed too quickly 
into conflict” by the US without the support of the UN and in the face of hostility from 
many of the UK’s traditional allies.136

284.  On 17 March, President Bush issued an ultimatum giving Saddam Hussein 
48 hours to leave Iraq.

285.  The French President’s office issued a statement early on 18 March stating that 
the US ultimatum was a unilateral decision going against the will of the international 
community who wanted to pursue Iraqi disarmament in accordance with resolution 
1441.137 It stated:

“... only the Security Council is authorised to legitimise the use of force. France 
appeals to the responsibility of all to see that international legality is respected. 
To disregard the legitimacy of the UN, to favour force over the law, would be to 
take on a heavy responsibility.” 

286.  On the evening of 18 March, the House of Commons passed by 412 votes to 149 
a motion supporting “the decision of Her Majesty’s Government that the United Kingdom 
should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq’s weapons of mass 
destruction”.

287.  President Bush wrote in his memoir that he convened “the entire National Security 
Council” on the morning of 19 March where he “gave the order to launch Operation 
Iraqi Freedom”.138

288.  In the Security Council debate on 19 March, the majority of members of the 
Security Council, including France, Russia and China, made clear that they thought 
the goal of disarming Iraq could be achieved by peaceful means and emphasised the 
primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace 
and security.139 

289.  UNMOVIC and the IAEA had provided the work programmes required by resolution 
1284. They included 12 key tasks identified by UNMOVIC where progress “could have 
an impact on the Council’s assessment of co‑operation of Iraq”.

290.  Shortly before midnight on 19 March, the US informed Sir David Manning that 
there was to be a change to the plan and US airstrikes would be launched at 0300 GMT 
on 20 March.140

291.  Early on the morning of 20 March, US forces crossed into Iraq and seized the port 
area of Umm Qasr.141 

292.  Mr Blair continued to state that France was responsible for the impasse. 

293.  At Cabinet on 20 March, Mr Blair concluded that the Government:

“... should lose no opportunity to propagate the reason, at every level and as widely 
as possible, why we had arrived at a diplomatic impasse, and why it was necessary 
to take action against Iraq. France had not been prepared to accept that Iraq’s 
failure to comply with its obligations should lead to the use of force to achieve 
compliance.”142

# Why Iraq? Why now?
294.  In his memoir, Mr Blair described his speech opening the debate on 18 March 
as “the most important speech I had ever made”.143 

295.  Mr Blair framed the decision for the House of Commons as a “tough” and “stark” 
choice between “retreat” and holding firm to the course of action the Government had 
set. Mr Blair stated that he believed “passionately” in the latter. He deployed a wide 
range of arguments to explain the grounds for military action and to make a persuasive 
case for the Government’s policy.144

296.  In setting out his position, Mr Blair recognised the gravity of the debate and the 
strength of opposition in both the country and Parliament to immediate military action. 
In his view, the issue mattered “so much” because the outcome would not just determine 
the fate of the Iraqi regime and the Iraqi people but would:

“... determine the way in which Britain and the world confront the central security 
threat of the 21st century, the development of the United Nations, the relationship 
between Europe and the United States, the relations within the European Union and 
the way in which the United States engages with the rest of the world. So it could 
hardly be more important. It will determine the pattern of international politics for 
the next generation.”

# Was Iraq a serious or imminent threat?
297.  On 18 March 2003, the House of Commons was asked:

*  to recognise that Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and long‑range missiles, 

and its continuing non‑compliance with Security Council resolutions, posed 
a threat to international peace and security; and

144 House of Commons, Official Report, 18 March 2003, columns 760‑774.

*  to support the use of all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq’s 

weapons of mass destruction, on the basis that the United Kingdom must uphold 
the authority of the United Nations as set out in resolution 1441 and many 
resolutions preceding it. 

298.  In his statement, Mr Blair addressed both the threat to international peace 
and security presented by Iraq’s defiance of the UN and its failure to comply with its 
disarmament obligations as set out in resolution 1441 (2002). Iraq was “the test of 
whether we treat the threat seriously”.

299.  Mr Blair rehearsed the Government’s position on Iraq’s past pursuit and use of 
weapons of mass destruction; its failures to comply with the obligations imposed by 
the UN Security Council between 1991 and 1998; Iraq’s repeated declarations which 
proved to be false; and the “large quantities of weapons of mass destruction” which 
were “unaccounted for”. He described UNSCOM’s final report (in January 1999) as 
“a withering indictment of Saddam’s lies, deception and obstruction”. 

300.  Mr Blair cited the UNMOVIC “clusters” document issued on 7 March as “a 
remarkable document”, detailing “all the unanswered questions about Iraq’s weapons 
of mass destruction”, listing “29 different areas in which the inspectors have been unable 
to obtain information”. 

301.  He stated that, based on Iraq’s false declaration, its failure to co‑operate, the 
unanswered questions in the UNMOVIC “clusters” document, and the unaccounted for 
material, the Security Council should have convened and condemned Iraq as in material 
breach of its obligations. If Saddam Hussein continued to fail to co‑operate, force should 
be used.

302.  Addressing the wider message from the issue of Iraq, Mr Blair asked:

“... what ... would any tyrannical regime possessing weapons of mass destruction 
think when viewing the history of the world’s diplomatic dance with Saddam over ... 
12 years? That our capacity to pass firm resolutions has only been matched by our 
feebleness in implementing them.”

303.  Mr Blair acknowledged that Iraq was “not the only country with weapons of mass 
destruction”, but declared: “back away from this confrontation now, and future conflicts 
will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects”. 

304.  Mr Blair added:

“The real problem is that ... people dispute Iraq is a threat, dispute the link between 
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and dispute in other words, the whole 
basis of our assertion that the two together constitute a fundamental assault on our 
way of life.”


305.  Mr Blair also described a “threat of chaos and disorder” arising from “tyrannical 
regimes with weapons of mass destruction and extreme terrorist groups” prepared 
to use them. 

306.  Mr Blair set out his concerns about:

*  proliferators of nuclear equipment or expertise;
*  “dictatorships with highly repressive regimes” who were “desperately trying to 

acquire” chemical, biological or, “particularly, nuclear weapons capability” – 
some of those were “a short time away from having a serviceable nuclear 
weapon”, and that activity was increasing, not diminishing; and

*  the possibility of terrorist groups obtaining and using weapons of mass 

destruction, including a “radiological bomb”.

307.  Those two threats had very different motives and different origins. He accepted 
“fully” that the association between the two was:

“... loose – but it is hardening. The possibility of the two coming together – of terrorist 
groups in possession of weapons of mass destruction or even of a so called dirty 
radiological bomb – is now in my judgement, a real and present danger to Britain 
and its national security.”

308.  Later in his speech, Mr Blair stated that the threat which Saddam Hussein’s 
arsenal posed:

“... to British citizens at home and abroad cannot simply be contained. Whether 
in the hands of his regime or in the hands of the terrorists to whom he would give 
his weapons, they pose a clear danger to British citizens ...”

309.  This fusion of long‑standing concerns about proliferation with the post‑9/11 
concerns about mass‑casualty terrorism was at the heart of the Government’s case 
for taking action at this time against Iraq. 

310.  The UK assessment of Iraq’s capabilities set out in Section 4 of the Report shows:
*  The proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their delivery 
systems, particularly ballistic missiles, was regarded as a major threat. But Iran, 
North Korea and Libya were of greater concern than Iraq in terms of the risk of 
nuclear and missile proliferation.

*  JIC Assessments, reflected in the September 2002 dossier, had consistently 
taken the view that, if sanctions were removed or became ineffective, it would 
take Iraq at least five years following the end of sanctions to produce enough 
fissile material for a weapon. On 7 March, the IAEA had reported to the Security 
Council that there was no indication that Iraq had resumed its nuclear activities. 
*  The September dossier stated that Iraq could produce a nuclear weapon within 
one to two years if it obtained fissile material and other essential components 

from a foreign supplier. There was no evidence that Iraq had tried to acquire 
fissile material and other components or – were it able to do so – that it had the 
technical capabilities to turn these materials into a usable weapon.

*  JIC Assessments had identified the possible stocks of chemical and biological 
weapons which would largely have been for short‑range, battlefield use by the 
Iraqi armed forces. The JIC had also judged in the September dossier that Iraq 
was producing chemical and biological agents and that there were development 
programmes for longer‑range missiles capable of delivering them. 

*  Iraq’s proscribed Al Samoud 2 missiles were being destroyed. 

311.  The UK Government did have significant concerns about the potential risks of all 
types of weapons of mass destruction being obtained by Islamist extremists (in particular 
Al Qaida) who would be prepared to use such weapons.

312.  Saddam Hussein’s regime had the potential to proliferate material and know‑how, 
to terrorist groups, but it was not judged likely to do so. 

313.  On 28 November 2001, the JIC assessed that:

*  Saddam Hussein had “refused to permit any Al Qaida presence in Iraq”.
*  Evidence of contact between Iraq and Usama Bin Laden (UBL) was 

“fragmentary and uncorroborated”; including that Iraq had been in contact 
with Al Qaida for exploratory discussions on toxic materials in late 1988.

*  “With common enemies ... there was clearly scope for collaboration.” 
*  There was “no evidence that these contacts led to practical co‑operation; 
we judge it unlikely ... There is no evidence UBL’s organisation has ever 
had a presence in Iraq.”

*  Practical co‑operation between Iraq and Al Qaida was “unlikely because 
*  There was “no credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD‑related technology 

of mutual mistrust”.

and expertise to terrorist groups”.145

314.  On 29 January 2003, the JIC assessed that, despite the presence of terrorists in 
Iraq “with links to Al Qaida”, there was “no intelligence of current co‑operation between 
Iraq and Al Qaida”.146

315.  On 10 February 2003, the JIC judged that Al Qaida would “not carry out attacks 
under Iraqi direction”.147

316.  Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry:

“... I don’t think the Prime Minister ever accepted the link between Iraq and terrorism. 
I think it would be fair to say that the Prime Minister was very worried about the 
possible conjunction of terrorism and WMD, but not specifically in relation to Iraq ... 
[I] think, one could say this is one of his primary national security concerns given the 
nature of Al Qaida.”148

317.  The JIC assessed that Iraq was likely to mount a terrorist attack only in response 
to military action and if the existence of the regime was threatened.

318.  The JIC Assessment of 10 October 2002 stated that Saddam Hussein’s “overriding 
objective” was to “avoid a US attack that would threaten his regime”.149 The JIC judged 
that, in the event of US‑led military action against Iraq, Saddam would: 

“... aim to use terrorism or the threat of it. Fearing the US response, he is likely to 
weigh the costs and benefits carefully in deciding the timing and circumstances in 
which terrorism is used. But intelligence on Iraq’s capabilities and intentions in this 
field is limited.”

319.  The JIC also judged that:

*  Saddam’s “capability to conduct effective terrorist attacks” was “very limited”.
*  Iraq’s “terrorism capability” was “inadequate to carry out chemical or biological 

attacks beyond individual assassination attempts using poisons”. 

320.  The JIC Assessment of 29 January 2003 sustained its earlier judgements on Iraq’s 
ability and intent to conduct terrorist operations.150

321.  Sir David Omand, the Security and Intelligence Co‑ordinator in the Cabinet Office 
from 2002 to 2005, told the Inquiry that, in March 2002, the Security Service judged that 
the “threat from terrorism from Saddam’s own intelligence apparatus in the event of an 
intervention in Iraq ... was judged to be limited and containable”.151 

322.  Baroness Manningham‑Buller, the Director General of the Security Service 
from 2002 to 2007, confirmed that position, stating that the Security Service felt there 
was “a pretty good intelligence picture of a threat from Iraq within the UK and to 
British interests”.152

152 Public hearing, 20 July 2010, page 6.

323.  Baroness Manningham‑Buller added that subsequent events showed the 
judgement that Saddam Hussein did not have the capability to do anything much 
in the UK, had “turned out to be the right judgement”.153

324.  While it was reasonable for the Government to be concerned about the fusion of 
proliferation and terrorism, there was no basis in the JIC Assessments to suggest that 
Iraq itself represented such a threat.

325.  The UK Government assessed that Iraq had failed to comply with a series of 
UN resolutions. Instead of disarming as these resolutions had demanded, Iraq was 
assessed to have concealed materials from past inspections and to have taken the 
opportunity of the absence of inspections to revive its WMD programmes.

326.  In Section 4, the Inquiry has identified the importance of the ingrained belief of 
the Government and the intelligence community that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained 
chemical and biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible 
enhance its capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and 
was pursuing an active and successful policy of deception and concealment. 

327.  This construct remained influential despite the lack of significant finds by inspectors 
in the period leading up to military action in March 2003, and even after the Occupation 
of Iraq. 

328.  Challenging Saddam Hussein’s “claim” that he had no weapons of mass 
destruction, Mr Blair said in his speech on 18 March:

*  “... we are asked to believe that after seven years of obstruction and 

non‑compliance ... he [Saddam Hussein] voluntarily decided to do what he had 
consistently refused to do under coercion.”

*  “We are asked now seriously to accept that in the last few years – contrary to 
all history, contrary to all intelligence – Saddam decided unilaterally to destroy 
those weapons. I say that such a claim is palpably absurd.”

*  “... Iraq continues to deny that it has any weapons of mass destruction, although 
*  “What is perfectly clear is that Saddam is playing the same old games in 

no serious intelligence service anywhere in the world believes it.” 

the same old way. Yes, there are minor concessions, but there has been no 
fundamental change of heart or mind.”154

329.  At no stage was the proposition that Iraq might no longer have chemical, biological 
or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either the JIC or the 
policy community.

153 Public hearing, 20 July 2010, page 9.
154 House of Commons, Official Report, 18 March 2003, columns 760‑764.


330.  Intelligence and assessments were used to prepare material to be used to support 
Government statements in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the 
limitations of the intelligence.

331.  Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons on 18 March was the culmination 
of a series of public statements and interviews setting out the urgent need for the 
international community to act to bring about Iraq’s disarmament in accordance with 
those resolutions, dating back to February 2002, before his meeting with President Bush 
at Crawford on 5 and 6 April.

332.  As Mr Cook’s resignation statement on 17 March made clear, it was possible for a 
Minister to draw different conclusions from the same information. 

333.  Mr Cook set out his doubts about Saddam Hussein’s ability to deliver a strategic 
attack and the degree to which Iraq posed a “clear and present danger” to the UK. 
The points Mr Cook made included:

*  “... neither the international community nor the British public is persuaded that 
*  “Over the past decade that strategy [of containment] had destroyed more 

there is an urgent and compelling reason for this military action in Iraq.”

weapons than in the Gulf War, dismantled Iraq’s nuclear weapons programme 
and halted Saddam’s medium and long range missile programmes.”

*  “Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood 
sense of the term – namely a credible device capable of being delivered against 
a strategic city target. It probably ... has biological toxins and battlefield chemical 
munitions, but it has had them since the 1980s when US companies sold 
Saddam anthrax agents and the then British Government approved chemical and 
munitions factories. Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action 
to disarm a military capacity that has been there for twenty years, and which we 
helped to create? Why is it necessary to resort to war this week, while Saddam’s 
ambition to complete his weapons programme is blocked by the presence of 
UN inspectors?”155 

334.  On 12 October 2004, announcing the withdrawal of two lines of intelligence 
reporting which had contributed to the pre‑conflict judgements on mobile biological 
production facilities and the regime’s intentions, Mr Straw stated that he did:

“... not accept, even with hindsight, that we were wrong to act as we did in the 
circumstances that we faced at the time. Even after reading all the evidence detailed 
by the Iraq Survey Group, it is still hard to believe that any regime could behave 
in so self‑destructive a manner as to pretend that it had forbidden weaponry, when 
in fact it had not.”156

156 House of Commons, Official Report, 12 October 2004, columns 151‑152.

335.  Iraq had acted suspiciously over many years, which led to the inferences drawn 
by the Government and the intelligence community that it had been seeking to protect 
concealed WMD assets. When Iraq denied that it had retained any WMD capabilities, 
the UK Government accused it of lying. 

336.  This led the Government to emphasise the ability of Iraq successfully to deceive 
the inspectors, and cast doubt on the investigative capacity of the inspectors. The role 
of the inspectors, however, as was often pointed out, was not to seek out assets that 
had been hidden, but rather to validate Iraqi claims.

337.  By March 2003, however:

interviews outside Iraq. 

338.  When the UK sought a further Security Council resolution in March 2003, the 
majority of the Council’s members were not persuaded that the inspections process, and 
the diplomatic efforts surrounding it, had reached the end of the road. They did not agree 
that the time had come to terminate inspections and resort to force. The UK went to war 
without the explicit authorisation which it had sought from the Security Council. 

339.  At the time of the Parliamentary vote of 18 March, diplomatic options had not been 
exhausted. The point had not been reached where military action was the last resort. 

# The predicted increase in the threat to the UK as a result of military action in Iraq

340.  Mr Blair had been advised that an invasion of Iraq was expected to increase 
the threat to the UK and UK interests from Al Qaida and its affiliates.

341.  Asked about the risk that attacking Iraq with cruise missiles would “act as a 
recruiting sergeant for a young generation throughout the Islamic and Arab world”, 
Mr Blair responded that:

“... what was shocking about 11 September was not just the slaughter of innocent 
people but the knowledge that, had the terrorists been able, there would have 
been not 3,000 innocent dead, but 30,000 or 300,000 ... America did not attack 
the Al Qaida terrorist group ... [it] attacked America. They did not need to be 


recruited ... Unless we take action against them, they will grow. That is why we 
should act.”157

342.  The JIC judged in October 2002 that “the greatest terrorist threat in the event of 
military action against Iraq will come from Al Qaida and other Islamic extremists”; and 
they would be “pursuing their own agenda”.158 

343.  The JIC Assessment of 10 February 2003 repeated previous warnings that:

*  Al Qaida and associated networks would remain the greatest terrorist threat 
to the UK and its activity would increase at the onset of any military action 
against Iraq.

*  In the event of imminent regime collapse, Iraqi chemical and biological material 

could be transferred to terrorists, including Al Qaida.159

344.  Addressing the prospects for the future, the JIC Assessment concluded:

“... Al Qaida and associated groups will continue to represent by far the 
greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that threat will be heightened 
by military action against Iraq. The broader threat from Islamist terrorists will also 
increase in the event of war, reflecting intensified anti‑US/anti‑Western sentiment in 
the Muslim world, including among Muslim communities in the West. And there is a 
risk that the transfer of CB [chemical and biological] material or expertise, during or 
in the aftermath of conflict, will enhance Al Qaida’s capabilities.”

345.  In response to a call for Muslims everywhere to take up arms in defence of Iraq 
issued by Usama Bin Laden on 11 February, and a further call on 16 February for 
“compulsory jihad” by Muslims against the West, the JIC Assessment on 19 February 
predicted that the upward trend in the reports of threats to the UK was likely to 
continue.160

346.  The JIC continued to warn in March that the threat from Al Qaida would increase 
at the onset of military action against Iraq.161

347.  The JIC also warned that:

*  Al Qaida activity in northern Iraq continued.
*  Al Qaida might have established sleeper cells in Baghdad, to be activated during 

a US occupation.

348.  The warning about the risk of chemical and biological weapons becoming available 
to extremist groups as a result of military action in Iraq was reiterated on 19 March.162

349.  Addressing the JIC Assessment of 10 February 2003, Mr Blair told the Intelligence 
and Security Committee (ISC) later that year that:

“One of the most difficult aspects of this is that there was obviously a danger that 
in attacking Iraq you ended up provoking the very thing you were trying to avoid. 
On the other hand I think you had to ask the question, ‘Could you really, as a 
result of that fear, leave the possibility that in time developed into a nexus between 
terrorism and WMD in an event?’ This is where you’ve just got to make your 
judgement about this. But this is my judgement and it remains my judgement 
and I suppose time will tell whether it’s true or it’s not true.”163

350.  In its response to the ISC Report, the Government drew:

“... attention to the difficult judgement that had to be made and the factors on both 
sides of the argument to be taken into account.”164

351.  Baroness Manningham‑Buller told the Inquiry: 

“By 2003/2004 we were receiving an increasing number of leads to terrorist activity 
from within the UK ... our involvement in Iraq radicalised, for want of a better word ... 
a few among a generation ... [who] saw our involvement in Iraq, on top of our 
involvement in Afghanistan, as being an attack on Islam.”165

352.  Asked about the proposition that it was right to remove Saddam Hussein’s regime 
to forestall a fusion of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism at 
some point in the future, and if it had eliminated a threat of terrorism from his regime, 
Baroness Manningham‑Buller replied:

“It eliminated the threat of terrorism from his direct regime; it didn’t eliminate the 
threat of terrorism using unconventional methods ... So using weapons of mass 
destruction as a terrorist weapon is still a potential threat.

“After all Usama Bin Laden said it was the duty of members of his organisation 
or those in sympathy with it to acquire and use these weapons. It is interesting 
that ... such efforts as we have seen to get access to these sort of materials have 
been low‑grade and not very professional, but it must be a cause of concern to my 
former colleagues that at some stage terrorist groups will resort to these methods.

Destruction – Intelligence and Assessments, 11 September 2003, February 2004, Cm6118, paragraph 22.

In that respect, I don’t think toppling Saddam Hussein is germane to the long‑term 
ambitions of some terrorist groups to use them.”166

353.  Asked specifically about the theory that at some point in the future Saddam 
Hussein would probably have brought together international terrorism and weapons 
of mass destruction in a threat to Western interests, Baroness Manningham‑Buller 
responded:

“It is a hypothetical theory. It certainly wasn’t of concern in either the short‑term 
or the medium‑term to my colleagues and myself.”167 

354.  Asked if “a war in Iraq would aggravate the threat from whatever source to 
the United Kingdom”, Baroness Manningham‑Buller stated that that was the view 
communicated by the JIC Assessments.168

355.  Baroness Manningham‑Buller subsequently added that if Ministers had read the 
JIC Assessments they could “have had no doubt” about that risk.169 She said that by the 
time of the July 2005 attacks in London:

“... an increasing number of British‑born individuals ... were attracted to the ideology 
of Usama Bin Laden and saw the West’s activities in Iraq and Afghanistan as 
threatening their fellow religionists and the Muslim world.” 

356.  Asked whether the judgement that the effect of the invasion of Iraq had increased 
the terrorist threat to the UK was based on hard evidence or a broader assessment, 
Baroness Manningham‑Buller replied:

“I think we can produce evidence because of the numerical evidence of the number 
of plots, the number of leads, the number of people identified, and the correlation of 
that to Iraq and statements of people as to why they were involved ... So I think the 
answer to your ... question: yes.”170 

357.  In its request for a statement, the Inquiry asked Mr Blair if he had read the JIC 
Assessment of 10 February 2002, and what weight he had given to it when he decided 
to take military action.171

358.  In his statement Mr Blair wrote:

“I was aware of the JIC Assessment of 10 February that the Al Qaida threat to the 
UK would increase. But I took the view then and take the same view now that to 
have backed down because of the threat of terrorism would be completely wrong.

In any event, following 9/11 and Afghanistan we were a terrorist target and, as recent 
events in Europe and the US show, irrespective of Iraq, there are ample justifications 
such terrorists will use as excuses for terrorism.”172 

# The UK’s relationship with the US
359.  The UK’s relationship with the US was a determining factor in the Government’s 
decisions over Iraq.

360.  It was the US Administration which decided in late 2001 to make dealing with the 
problem of Saddam Hussein’s regime the second priority, after the ousting of the Taliban 
in Afghanistan, in the “Global War on Terror”. In that period, the US Administration turned 
against a strategy of continued containment of Iraq, which it was pursuing before the 
9/11 attacks.

361.  This was not, initially, the view of the UK Government. Its stated view at that time 
was that containment had been broadly effective, and that it could be adapted in order 
to remain sustainable. Containment continued to be the declared policy of the UK 
throughout the first half of 2002.

362.  The declared objectives of the UK and the US towards Iraq up to the time of the 
invasion differed. The US was explicitly seeking to achieve a change of regime; the UK 
to achieve the disarmament of Iraq, as required by UN Security Council resolutions.

363.  Most crucially, the US Administration committed itself to a timetable for military 
action which did not align with, and eventually overrode, the timetable and processes 
for inspections in Iraq which had been set by the UN Security Council. The UK wanted 
UNMOVIC and the IAEA to have time to complete their work, and wanted the support 
of the Security Council, and of the international community more widely, before any 
further steps were taken. This option was foreclosed by the US decision.

364.  On these and other important points, including the planning for the post‑conflict 
period and the functioning of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), the UK 
Government decided that it was right or necessary to defer to its close ally and senior 
partner, the US.

365.  It did so essentially for two reasons:

be damaged if the UK did not give the US its full support over Iraq.

*  Concern that vital areas of co‑operation between the UK and the US could 
*  The belief that the best way to influence US policy towards the direction 
preferred by the UK was to commit full and unqualified support, and seek 
to persuade from the inside.

172 Statement, 14 January 2011, page 16.


366.  The UK Government was right to think very carefully about both of those points.

367.  First, the close strategic alliance with the US has been a cornerstone of the UK’s 
foreign and security policy under successive governments since the Second World War. 
Mr Blair rightly attached great importance to preserving and strengthening it. 

368.  After the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, that relationship was reinforced 
when Mr Blair declared that the UK would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US to 
defeat and eradicate international terrorism.173 The action that followed in Afghanistan 
to bring about the fall of the Taliban served to strengthen and deepen the sense of 
shared endeavour. 

369.  When the US Administration turned its attention to regime change in Iraq as part 
of the second phase of the “Global War on Terror”, Mr Blair’s immediate response was 
to seek to offer a partnership and to work with it to build international support for the 
position that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with.

370.  In Mr Blair’s view, the decision to stand alongside the US was in the UK’s long‑term 
national interests. In his speech of 18 March 2003, he argued that the handling of Iraq 
would:

“... determine the way in which Britain and the world confront the central security 
threat of the 21st century, the development of the United Nations, the relationship 
between Europe and the United States, the relations within the European Union and 
the way in which the United States engages with the rest of the world. So it could 
hardly be more important. It will determine the pattern of international politics for 
the next generation.”

371.  In his memoir in 2010, Mr Blair wrote: 

“I knew in the final analysis I would be with the US, because it was right morally 
and strategically. But we should make a last ditch attempt for a peaceful solution. 
First to make the moral case for removing Saddam ... Second, to try one more time 
to reunite the international community behind a clear base for action in the event of 
a continuing breach.”174 

372.  Concern about the consequences, were the UK not to give full support to the 
US, featured prominently in policy calculations across Whitehall. Mr Hoon, for example, 
sought advice from Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, on the 
implications for the alliance of the UK’s approach to Iraq.175

373.  Although there has historically been a very close relationship between the British 
and American peoples and a close identity of values between our democracies, it is an 

173 The National Archives, 11 September 2001, September 11 attacks: Prime Minister’s statement.
174 Blair T. A Journey. Hutchinson, 2010. 
175 Minute Tebbit to Secretary of State [MOD], 14 January 2003, ‘Iraq: What If?’.

alliance founded not on emotion, but on a hard‑headed appreciation of mutual benefit. 
The benefits do not by any means flow only in one direction. 

374.  In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote:

“... I agreed with the basic US analysis of Saddam as a threat; I thought he was a 
monster; and to break the US partnership in such circumstances, when America’s 
key allies were all rallying round, would in my view, then (and now) have done major 
long‑term damage to that relationship.” 

375.  The Government was right to weigh the possible consequences for the wider 
alliance with the US very carefully, as previous Governments have done. A policy 
of direct opposition to the US would have done serious short‑term damage to the 
relationship, but it is questionable whether it would have broken the partnership. 

376.  Over the past seven decades, the UK and US have adopted differing, and 
sometimes conflicting, positions on major issues, for example Suez, the Vietnam War, the 
Falklands, Grenada, Bosnia, the Arab/Israel dispute and, at times, Northern Ireland. Those 
differences did not fundamentally call into question the practice of close co‑operation, 
to mutual advantage, on the overall relationship, including defence and intelligence.

377.  The opposition of Germany and France to US policy in 2002 to 2003 does not 
appear to have had a lasting impact on the relationships of those countries with the 
US, despite the bitterness at the time.

378.  However, a decision not to oppose does not have to be translated into unqualified 
support. Throughout the post‑Second World War period (and, notably, during the 
wartime alliance), the UK’s relationship with the US and the commonality of interests 
therein have proved strong enough to bear the weight of different approaches to 
international problems and not infrequent disagreements. 

379.  Had the UK stood by its differing position on Iraq – which was not an opposed 
position, but one in which the UK had identified conditions seen as vital by the UK 
Government – the Inquiry does not consider that this would have led to a fundamental 
or lasting change in the UK’s relationship with the US. 

380.  This is a matter of judgement, and one on which Mr Blair, bearing the responsibility 
of leadership, took a different view.

381.  The second reason for committing unqualified support was, by standing alongside 
and taking part in the planning, the UK would be able to influence US policy.

382.  Mr Blair’s stalwart support for the US after 9/11 had a significant impact in that 
country. Mr Blair developed a close working relationship with President Bush. He used 
this to compare notes and inject his views on the major issues of the day, and it is clear 
from the records of the discussions that President Bush encouraged that dialogue and 
listened to Mr Blair’s opinions. 


383.  Mr Blair expressed his views in frequent telephone calls and in meetings with the 
President. There was also a very active channel between his Foreign Affairs Adviser and 
the President’s National Security Advisor. Mr Blair also sent detailed written Notes to the 
President.

384.  Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, told the Inquiry:

“... the Prime Minister had a habit of writing notes, both internally and to President 
Clinton and to President Bush, on all sorts of subjects, because he found it better 
to put something in writing rather than to simply talk about it orally and get it much 
more concretely ... in focused terms.”176

385.  Mr Blair drew on information and briefing received from Whitehall departments, 
but evidently drafted many or most of his Notes to the President himself, showing 
the drafts to his close advisers in No.10 but not (ahead of despatch) to the relevant 
Cabinet Ministers.

386.  How best to exercise influence with the President of the United States is a matter 
for the tactical judgement of the Prime Minister, and will vary between Prime Ministers 
and Presidents. In relation to Iraq, Mr Blair’s judgement, as he and others have 
explained, was that objectives the UK identified for a successful strategy should not 
be expressed as conditions for its support. 

387.  Mr Powell told the Inquiry that Mr Blair was offering the US a “partnership to try 
to get to a wide coalition” and “setting out a framework” and to try to persuade the US 
to move in a particular direction.177 

388.  Mr Blair undoubtedly influenced the President’s decision to go to the UN Security 
Council in the autumn of 2002. On other critical decisions set out in the Report, he did 
not succeed in changing the approach determined in Washington. 

389.  This issue is addressed in the Lessons section of this Executive Summary, under 
the heading “The decision to go to war”. 

# Decision‑making
390.  The way in which the policy on Iraq was developed and decisions were taken and 
implemented within the UK Government has been at the heart of the Inquiry’s work and 
fundamental to its conclusions. 

391.  The Inquiry has set out in Section 2 of the Report the roles and responsibilities 
of key individuals and bodies in order to assist the reader. It is also publishing with the 
Report many of the documents which illuminate who took the key decisions and on what 

176 Public hearing, 18 January 2010, page 38. 
177 Public hearing, 18 January 2010, pages 77‑78.

basis, including the full record of the discussion on Iraq in Cabinet on five key occasions 
pre‑conflict, and policy advice to Ministers which is not normally disclosed.

# Collective responsibility
392.  Under UK constitutional conventions – in which the Prime Minister leads the 
Government – Cabinet is the main mechanism by which the most senior members 
of the Government take collective responsibility for its most important decisions. 
Cabinet is supported by a system of Ministerial Committees whose role is to identify, 
test and develop policy options; analyse and mitigate risks; and debate and hone policy 
proposals until they are endorsed across the Government.178 

393.  The Ministerial Code in place in 2003 said:

“The Cabinet is supported by Ministerial Committees (both standing and ad hoc) 
which have a two‑fold purpose. First, they relieve the pressure on the Cabinet 
itself by settling as much business as possible at a lower level or, failing that, 
by clarifying the issues and defining the points of disagreement. Second, they 
support the principle of collective responsibility by ensuring that, even though an 
important question may never reach the Cabinet itself, the decision will be fully 
considered and the final judgement will be sufficiently authoritative to ensure that the 
Government as a whole can properly be expected to accept responsibility for it.”179 

394.  The Code also said:

“The business of the Cabinet and Ministerial Committees consists in the main of:

a.  questions which significantly engage the collective responsibility of the 
Government because they raise major issues of policy or because they 
are of critical importance to the public;

b.  questions on which there is an unresolved argument between 

Departments.”

395.  Lord Wilson of Dinton told the Inquiry that between January 1998 and January 
1999, in the run‑up to and immediate aftermath of Operation Desert Fox in December 
1998 (see Section 1.1), as Cabinet Secretary, he had attended and noted 21 Ministerial 
discussions on Iraq: 10 in Cabinet, of which seven had “some substance”; five in DOP; 
and six ad hoc meetings, including one JIC briefing.180 Discussions in Cabinet or a 
Cabinet Committee would have been supported by the relevant part of the Cabinet 
Secretariat, the Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec).

178 Ministerial Code, 2001, page 3.
179 Ministerial Code, 2001, page 3. 
180 Public hearing, 25 January 2011, page 11.


396.  Similarly, Lord Wilson stated that, between 11 September 2001 and January 2002, 
the Government’s response to international terrorism and the subsequent military action 
against the Taliban in Afghanistan had been managed through 46 Ministerial meetings.181

397.  The last meeting of DOP on Iraq before the 2003 conflict, however, took place 
in March 1999.182 

398.  In April 2002, the MOD clearly expected consideration of military options to be 
addressed through DOP. Mr Simon Webb, the MOD Policy Director, advised Mr Hoon 
that:

“Even these preparatory steps would properly need a Cabinet Committee decision, 
based on a minute from the Defence Secretary ...”183

399.  Most decisions on Iraq pre‑conflict were taken either bilaterally between Mr Blair 
and the relevant Secretary of State or in meetings between Mr Blair, Mr Straw and 
Mr Hoon, with No.10 officials and, as appropriate, Mr John Scarlett (Chairman of the 
JIC), Sir Richard Dearlove and Adm Boyce. Some of those meetings were minuted; 
some were not.

400.  As the guidance for the Cabinet Secretariat makes clear, the purpose of the minute 
of a meeting is to set out the conclusions reached so that those who have to take 
action know precisely what to do; the second purpose is to “give the reasons why the 
conclusions were reached”.184 

401.  Lord Turnbull, Cabinet Secretary from 2002 to 2005, described Mr Blair’s 
characteristic way of working with his Cabinet colleagues as: 

“… ‘I like to move fast. I don’t want to spend a lot of time in kind of conflict resolution, 
and, therefore, I will get the people who will make this thing move quickly and 
efficiently.’ That was his sort of characteristic style, but it has drawbacks.”185

402.  Lord Turnbull subsequently told the Inquiry that the group described above was 
“a professional forum ... they had ... with one possible exception [Ms Clare Short, the 
International Development Secretary], the right people in the room. It wasn’t the kind 
of sofa government in the sense of the Prime Minister and his special advisers and 
political cronies”.186

186 Public hearing, 13 January 2010, pages 45‑46.

403.  In July 2004, Lord Butler’s Report stated that his Committee was:

“... concerned that the informality and circumscribed character of the Government’s 
procedures which we saw in the context of policy‑making towards Iraq risks reducing 
the scope for informed collective political judgement. Such risks are particularly 
significant in a field like the subject of our Review, where hard facts are inherently 
difficult to come by and the quality of judgement is accordingly all the more 
important.”187 

404.  In response, Mr Blair agreed that:

“... where a small group is brought together to work on operational military planning 
and developing the diplomatic strategy, in future such a group will operate formally 
as an ad hoc Cabinet Committee.”188 

405.  The Inquiry considers that where policy options include significant military 
deployments, particularly where they will have implications for the responsibilities of 
more than one Cabinet Minister, are likely to be controversial, and/or are likely to give 
rise to significant risks, the options should be considered by a group of Ministers meeting 
regularly, whether or not they are formally designated as a Cabinet Committee, so that 
Cabinet as a whole can be enabled to take informed collective decisions.

406.  Describing the important function a Cabinet Committee can play, Mr Powell wrote:

“Most of the important decisions of the Blair Government were taken either in 
informal meetings of Ministers and officials or by Cabinet Committees ... Unlike 
the full Cabinet, a Cabinet Committee has the right people present, including, 
for example, the military Chiefs of Staff or scientific advisers, its members are 
well briefed, it can take as long as it likes over its discussion on the basis of 
well‑prepared papers, and it is independently chaired by a senior Minister with 
no departmental vested interest.”189

407.  The Inquiry concurs with this description of the function of a Cabinet Committee 
when it is working well. In particular, it recognises the important function which a 
Minister without departmental responsibilities for the issues under consideration can 
play. This can provide some external challenge from experienced members of the 
government and mitigate any tendency towards group‑think. In the case of Iraq, for 
example, the inclusion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer or Deputy Prime Minister, 
as senior members of the Cabinet, or of Mr Cook, as a former Foreign Secretary known 
to have concerns about the policy, could have provided an element of challenge.

Conclusions, March 2005, Cm6492.

408.  Mr Powell likewise recognises the importance of having written advice which can 
be seen before a meeting, allowing all those present to have shared information and 
the opportunity to digest it and seek further advice if necessary. This allows the time in 
meetings to be used productively.

409.  The Inquiry considers that there should have been collective discussion by a 
Cabinet Committee or small group of Ministers on the basis of inter‑departmental advice 
agreed at a senior level between officials at a number of decision points which had a 
major impact on the development of UK policy before the invasion of Iraq. Those were: 
*  The decision at the beginning of December 2001 to offer to work with President 
Bush on a strategy to deal with Iraq as part of Phase 2 of the “War on Terror”, 
despite the fact that there was no evidence of any Iraqi involvement with the 
attacks on the US or active links to Al Qaida. 

*  The adoption of the position at the end of February 2002 that Iraq was a threat 
which had to be dealt with, together with the assumption that the only certain 
means to remove Saddam Hussein and his regime was to invade Iraq and 
impose a new government. 

*  The position Mr Blair should adopt in discussions with President Bush at 
Crawford in April 2002. The meeting at Chequers on 2 April was given a 
presentation on the military options and did not explore the political and legal 
implications of a conflict with Iraq. There was no FCO representative at the 
Chequers meeting and no subsequent meeting with Mr Straw and Mr Hoon.
*  The position Mr Blair should adopt in his discussion with President Bush at 

Camp David on 5 and 6 September 2002. Mr Blair’s long Note of 28 July, telling 
President Bush “I will be with you, whatever”, was seen, before it was sent, only 
by No.10 officials. A copy was sent afterwards to Mr Straw, but not to Mr Hoon. 
While the Note was marked “Personal” (to signal that it should have a restricted 
circulation), it represented an extensive statement of the UK Government’s 
position by the Prime Minister to the President of the United States. The Foreign 
and Defence Secretaries should certainly have been given an opportunity to 
comment on the draft in advance.

a deadline for a vote in the Security Council of 14 March.

*  A review of UK policy at the end of February 2003 when the inspectors had 

found no evidence of WMD and there was only limited support for the second 
resolution in the Security Council. 

*  The question of whether Iraq had committed further material breaches as 
specified in operative paragraph 4 of resolution 1441 (2002), as posed in 
Mr Brummell’s letter of 14 March to Mr Rycroft.

410.  In addition to providing a mechanism to probe and challenge the implications 
of proposals before decisions were taken, a Cabinet Committee or a more structured 
process might have identified some of the wider implications and risks associated 
with the deployment of military forces to Iraq. It might also have offered the opportunity 
to remedy some of the deficiencies in planning which are identified in Section 6 of 
the Report. There will, of course, be other policy issues which would benefit from 
the same approach.

411.  Cabinet has a different role to that of a Cabinet Committee.

412.  Mr Powell has written that:

“... Cabinet is the right place to ratify decisions, the right place for people to raise 
concerns if they have not done so before, the right place for briefings by the Prime 
Minister and other Ministers on strategic issues, the right place to ensure political 
unity; but it is categorically not the right place for an informed decision on difficult 
and detailed policy issues.”190

413.  In 2009, in a statement explaining a Cabinet decision to veto the release of 
minutes of one of its meetings under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, Mr Straw 
explained the need for frank discussion at Cabinet very cogently: 

“Serious and controversial decisions must be taken with free, frank – even blunt 
deliberations between colleagues. Dialogue must be fearless. Ministers must have 
the confidence to challenge each other in private. They must ensure that decisions 
have been properly thought through, sounding out all possibilities before committing 
themselves to a course of action. They must not feel inhibited from advancing 
options that may be unpopular or controversial. They must not be deflected from 
expressing dissent by the fear that they may be held personally to account for views 
that are later cast aside.”191

2009 (Ref: EA/2008/0024 and EA/2008/0029): Statement of Reasons’.


414.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that:

“... the discussion that we had in Cabinet was substantive discussion. We had it 
again and again and again, and the options were very simple. The options were: 
a sanctions framework that was effective; alternatively, the UN inspectors doing 
the job; alternatively, you have to remove Saddam. Those were the options.”192 

415.  Mr Blair added:

“Nobody in the Cabinet was unaware of ... what the whole issue was about. It was 
the thing running throughout the whole of the political mainstream at the time. 
There were members of the Cabinet who would challenge and disagree, but most 
of them agreed.”193

416.  The Inquiry has seen the minutes of 26 meetings of Cabinet between 28 February 
2002 and 17 March 2003 at which Iraq was mentioned and Cabinet Secretariat 
notebooks. Cabinet was certainly given updates on diplomatic developments and 
had opportunities to discuss the general issues. The number of occasions on which 
there was a substantive discussion of the policy was very much more limited.

417.  There were substantive discussions of the policy on Iraq, although not necessarily 
of all the issues (as the Report sets out), in Cabinet on 7 March and 23 September 2002 
and 16 January, 13 March and 17 March 2003. Those are the records which are being 
published with the Report. 

418.  At the Cabinet meeting on 7 March 2002, Mr Blair concluded:

“... the concerns expressed in discussion were justified. It was important that the 
United States did not appear to be acting unilaterally. It was critically important 
to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process. Any military action taken against 
President Saddam Hussein’s regime had to be effective. On the other hand, the 
Iraqi regime was in clear breach of its obligations under several United Nations 
Security Council resolutions. Its WMD programmes posed a threat to peace. 
Iraq’s neighbours regarded President Saddam Hussein as a danger. The right 
strategy was to engage closely with the Government of the United States in order 
to be in a position to shape policy and its presentation. The international community 
should proceed in a measured but determined way to decide how to respond to the 
real threat represented by the Iraqi regime. No decisions to launch military action 
had been taken and any action taken would be in accordance with international law.

“The Cabinet, ‘Took note, with approval.’”194

194 Cabinet Conclusions, 7 March 2002.

419.  Cabinet on 17 March 2003 noted Mr Blair’s conclusion that “the diplomatic process 
was at an end; Saddam Hussein would be given an ultimatum to leave Iraq; and the 
House of Commons would be asked to endorse the use of military action against Iraq to 
enforce compliance, if necessary”. 

420.  In Section 5 of the Report, the Inquiry concludes that Lord Goldsmith should have 
been asked to provide written advice which fully reflected the position on 17 March and 
explained the legal basis on which the UK could take military action and set out the risks 
of legal challenge.

421.  There was no substantive discussion of the military options, despite promises 
by Mr Blair, before the meeting on 17 March.

422.  In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Hoon wrote that by the time he joined Cabinet, 
in 1999:

“... the pattern of the organisation and format of Cabinet meetings was ... well 
established. Tony Blair was well known to be extremely concerned about leaks 
from Cabinet discussions ... It was my perception that, largely as a consequence 
of this, he did not normally expect key decisions to be made in the course of 
Cabinet meetings. Papers were submitted to the Cabinet Office, and in turn by 
the Cabinet Office to appropriate Cabinet Committees for decisions.”195

423.  Mr Hoon wrote:

“At no time when I was serving in the Ministry of Defence were other Cabinet 
Ministers involved in discussions about the deployment of specific forces and 
the nature of their operations. Relevant details would have been circulated to 
10 Downing Street or other Government departments as necessary ... I do not 
recall a single Cabinet level discussion of specific troop deployments and the 
nature of their operations.”196 

424.  The Inquiry recognises that there will be operational constraints on discussion 
of the details of military deployments, but that would not preclude the discussion of 
the principles and the implications of military options. 

425.  In January 2006, the Cabinet discussed the proposal to deploy military forces 
to Helmand later that year.

426.  The Inquiry also recognises that the nature of foreign policy, as the Report vividly 
demonstrates, requires the Prime Minister of the UK, the Foreign Secretary and their 
most senior officials to be involved in negotiating and agreeing policy on a day‑by‑day, 
and sometimes hour‑by‑hour basis. 

195 Statement, 2 April 2015, page 1.
196 Statement, 2 April 2015, page 2.


427.  It would neither be necessary nor feasible to seek a mandate from Cabinet at 
each stage of a discussion. That reinforces the importance of ensuring Cabinet is kept 
informed as strategy evolves, is given the opportunity to raise questions and is asked to 
endorse key decisions. Cabinet Ministers need more information than will be available 
from the media, especially on sensitive issues of foreign and security policy.

428.  In 2009, three former Cabinet Secretaries197 told the House of Lords Select 
Committee on the Constitution:

“... each of us, as Secretary of the Cabinet, has been constantly conscious of his 
responsibility to the Cabinet collectively and of the need to have regard to the needs 
and responsibilities of the other members of the Cabinet (and indeed of other 
Ministers) as well of those of the Prime Minister. That has coloured our relationships 
with Number 10 as well as those with other Ministers and their departments.”198

429.  Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that Mr Blair:

“... wanted a step change in the work on delivery and reform, which I hope 
I managed to give him. Now ... how does the Cabinet Secretary work? You come 
in and you are – even with the two roles that you have, head of an organisation of 
half a million civil servants and in some sense co‑ordinating a public sector of about 
five million people. You have to make choices as to where you make your effort, and 
I think the policy I followed was not to take an issue over from someone to whom 
it was delegated simply because it was big and important, but you have to make a 
judgement as to whether it is being handled competently, whether that particular part 
is, in a sense, under pressure, whether you think they are getting it wrong in some 
sense, or they are missing certain important things.”199 

430.  The responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary to ensure that members of Cabinet are 
fully engaged in ways that allow them to accept collective responsibility and to meet their 
departmental obligations nevertheless remains. 

# Advice on the legal basis for military action
431.  The Inquiry has reviewed the debate that took place within the Government and 
how it reached its decision. 

432.  The circumstances in which it was ultimately decided that there was a legal basis 
for UK participation were far from satisfactory.

433.  It was not until 13 March 2003 that Lord Goldsmith advised that there was, 
on balance, a secure legal basis for military action. 

197 Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, Lord Butler of Brockwell and Lord Wilson of Dinton. 
198 Fourth Report from the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution, Session 2009‑10, 
The Cabinet Office and the Centre of Government, HL Paper 30. 
199 Public hearing, 13 January 2010, page 3.

434.  In the letter of 14 March 2003 from Lord Goldsmith’s office to No.10, which is 
addressed in Section 5 of the Report, Mr Blair was told that an essential ingredient of 
the legal basis was that he, himself, should be satisfied of the fact that Iraq was in breach 
of resolution 1441.

435.  In accordance with that advice, it was Mr Blair who decided that, so far as the 
UK was concerned, Iraq was and remained in breach of resolution 1441. 

436.  Apart from No.10’s response to the letter of 14 March, sent the following day, 
in terms that can only be described as perfunctory, no formal record was made of that 
decision and the precise grounds on which it was made remain unclear.

437.  The Inquiry was told, and it accepts, that it would have been possible at that stage 
for the UK Government to have decided not to go ahead with military action if it had 
been necessary to make a decision to do so; or if the House of Commons on 18 March 
had voted against the Government. 

438.  Although, when resolution 1441 was adopted, there was unanimous support for a 
rigorous inspections and monitoring regime backed by the threat of military force as the 
means to disarm Iraq, there was no such consensus in the Security Council in March 
2003. If the matter had been left to the Security Council to decide, military action might 
have been postponed and, possibly, avoided.

439.  The Charter of the United Nations vests responsibility for the maintenance 
of peace and security in the Security Council. The UK Government was claiming 
to act on behalf of the international community “to uphold the authority of the Security 
Council”, knowing that it did not have a majority in the Security Council in support of 
its actions. In those circumstances, the UK’s actions undermined the authority of the 
Security Council. 

440.  A determination by the Security Council on whether Iraq was in fact in material 
breach of resolution 1441 would have furthered the UK’s aspiration to uphold the 
authority of the Council. 

# The timing of Lord Goldsmith’s advice on the interpretation of resolution 1441
441.  Following the adoption of resolution 1441, a decision was taken to delay the 
receipt of formal advice from Lord Goldsmith.

442.  On 11 November 2002, Mr Powell told Lord Goldsmith that there should be 
a meeting some time before Christmas to discuss the legal position. 

443.  On 9 December, formal “instructions” to provide advice were sent to Lord 
Goldsmith. They were sent by the FCO on behalf of the FCO and the MOD as 
well as No.10.


444.  The instructions made it clear that Lord Goldsmith should not provide an immediate 
response.

445.  When Lord Goldsmith met Mr Powell, Sir David Manning and Baroness Morgan 
(Director of Political and Government Relations to the Prime Minister) on 19 December, 
he was told that he was not, at that stage, being asked for his advice; and that, when 
he was, it would be helpful for him to discuss a draft with Mr Blair in the first instance.

446.  Until 7 March 2003, Mr Blair and Mr Powell asked that Lord Goldsmith’s views on 
the legal effect of resolution 1441 should be tightly held and not shared with Ministerial 
colleagues without No.10’s permission. 

447.  Lord Goldsmith agreed that approach.

448.  Lord Goldsmith provided draft advice to Mr Blair on 14 January 2003. As instructed 
he did not, at that time, provide a copy of his advice to Mr Straw or to Mr Hoon. 

449.  Although Lord Goldsmith was invited to attend Cabinet on 16 January, there was 
no discussion of Lord Goldsmith’s views.

450.  Mr Straw was aware, in general terms, of Lord Goldsmith’s position but he was 
not provided with a copy of Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice before Cabinet on 16 January. 
He did not read it until at least two weeks later.

451.  The draft advice of 14 January should have been provided to Mr Straw, Mr Hoon 
and the Cabinet Secretary, all of whose responsibilities were directly engaged. 

452.  Lord Goldsmith provided Mr Blair with further advice on 30 January. It was not 
seen by anyone outside No.10. 

453.  Lord Goldsmith discussed the negotiating history of resolution 1441 with Mr Straw, 
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, with White House officials and the State Department’s Legal 
Advisers. They argued that resolution 1441 could be interpreted as not requiring a 
second resolution. The US Government’s position was that it would not have agreed 
to resolution 1441 had its terms required one. 

454.  When Lord Goldsmith met No.10 officials on 27 February, he told them that he 
had reached the view that a “reasonable case” could be made that resolution 1441 was 
capable of reviving the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 (1990) without a 
further resolution, if there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed 
to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441.

455.  Until that time, No.10 could not have been sure that Lord Goldsmith would advise 
that there was a basis on which military action against Iraq could be taken in the 
absence of a further decision of the Security Council. 

456.  In the absence of Lord Goldsmith’s formal advice, uncertainties about the 
circumstances in which the UK would be able to participate in military action continued, 
although the possibility of a second resolution remained.

457.  Lord Goldsmith provided formal written advice on 7 March.

# Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March 2003
458.  Lord Goldsmith’s formal advice of 7 March set out alternative interpretations of 
the legal effect of resolution 1441. He concluded that the safer route would be to seek 
a second resolution, and he set out the ways in which, in the absence of a second 
resolution, the matter might be brought before a court. Lord Goldsmith identified a key 
question to be whether or not there was a need for an assessment of whether Iraq’s 
conduct constituted a failure to take the final opportunity or a failure fully to co‑operate 
within the meaning of operative paragraph 4, such that the basis of the cease‑fire 
was destroyed.

459.  Lord Goldsmith wrote (paragraph 26): “A narrow textual reading of the resolution 
suggested no such assessment was needed because the Security Council had 
pre‑determined the issue. Public statements, on the other hand, say otherwise.”

460.  While Lord Goldsmith remained “of the opinion that the safest legal course would 
be to secure a second resolution”, he concluded (paragraph 28) that “a reasonable case 
can be made that resolution 1441 was capable of reviving the authorisation in resolution 
678 without a further resolution”.

461.  Lord Goldsmith wrote that a reasonable case did not mean that, if the matter 
ever came to court, he would be confident that the court would agree with this view. 
He judged a court might well conclude that OPs 4 and 12 required a further Security 
Council decision in order to revive the authorisation in resolution 678.

462.  Lord Goldsmith noted that on a number of previous occasions, including in 
relation to Operation Desert Fox in Iraq in 1998 and Kosovo in 1999, UK forces had 
participated in military action on the basis of advice from previous Attorneys General 
that (paragraph 30) “the legality of the action under international law was no more than 
reasonably arguable”.

463.  Lord Goldsmith warned Mr Blair (paragraph 29):

“... the argument that resolution 1441 alone has revived the authorisation to use 
force in resolution 678 will only be sustainable if there are strong factual grounds  
for concluding that Iraq failed to take the final opportunity. In other words, we  
would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non‑compliance and  
non‑co‑operation ... the views of UNMOVIC and the IAEA will be highly significant 
in this respect.”


464.  Lord Goldsmith added:

“In the light of the latest reporting by UNMOVIC, you will need to consider extremely 
carefully whether the evidence of non‑co‑operation and non‑compliance by Iraq is 
sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq has failed to take its final 
opportunity.”

465.  Mr Straw, Mr Hoon, Dr John Reid (Minister without Portfolio and Labour Party 
Chair) and the Chiefs of Staff had all seen Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March before 
the No.10 meeting on 11 March, but it is not clear how and when it reached them.

466.  Other Ministers whose responsibilities were directly engaged, including 
Mr Gordon Brown (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Ms Short, and their senior officials, 
did not see the advice.

# Lord Goldsmith’s arrival at a “better view”
467.  At the meeting on 11 March, Mr Blair stated that Lord Goldsmith’s “advice made 
it clear that a reasonable case could be made” that resolution 1441 was “capable of 
reviving” the authorisation of resolution 678, “although of course a second resolution 
would be preferable”. There was concern, however, that the advice did not offer a clear 
indication that military action would be lawful. 

468.  Lord Goldsmith was asked, after the meeting, by Adm Boyce on behalf of the 
Armed Forces, and by the Treasury Solicitor, Ms Juliet Wheldon, in respect of the Civil 
Service, to give a clear‑cut answer on whether military action would be lawful rather 
than unlawful.

469.  On 12 March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw reached the view that there was no chance 
of securing a majority in the Security Council in support of the draft resolution of 7 March 
and there was a risk of one or more vetoes if the resolution was put to a vote. 

470.  There is no evidence to indicate that Lord Goldsmith was informed of their 
conclusion.

471.  Lord Goldsmith concluded on 13 March that, on balance, the “better view” was that 
the conditions for the operation of the revival argument were met in this case, meaning 
that there was a lawful basis for the use of force without a further resolution beyond 
resolution 1441.

# The exchange of letters on 14 and 15 March 2003
472.  Mr David Brummell (Legal Secretary to the Law Officers) wrote to Mr Matthew 
Rycroft (Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs) on 14 March:

“It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further resolution 
of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq has failed to comply 

with and co‑operate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441 and has thus 
failed to take the final opportunity offered by the Security Council in that resolution. 
The Attorney General understands that it is unequivocally the Prime Minister’s 
view that Iraq has committed further material breaches as specified in [operative] 
paragraph 4 of resolution 1441, but as this is a judgement for the Prime Minister, 
the Attorney would be grateful for confirmation that this is the case.”

473.  Mr Rycroft replied to Mr Brummell on 15 March:

“This is to confirm that it is indeed the Prime Minister’s unequivocal view that Iraq 
is in further material breach of its obligations, as in OP4 of UNSCR 1441, because 
of ‘false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to 
this resolution and failure to comply with, and co‑operate fully in the interpretation of, 
this resolution’.”

474.  It is unclear what specific grounds Mr Blair relied upon in reaching his view. 

475.  In his advice of 7 March, Lord Goldsmith had said that the views of UNMOVIC and 
the IAEA would be highly significant in demonstrating hard evidence of non‑compliance 
and non‑co‑operation. In the exchange of letters on 14 and 15 March between 
Mr Brummell and No.10, there is no reference to their views; the only view referred 
to was that of Mr Blair.

476.  Following receipt of Mr Brummell’s letter of 14 March, Mr Blair neither requested 
nor received considered advice addressing the evidence on which he expressed his 
“unequivocal view” that Iraq was “in further material breach of its obligations”.

477.  Senior Ministers should have considered the question posed in Mr Brummell’s 
letter of 14 March, either in the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee or a 
“War Cabinet”, on the basis of formal advice. Such a Committee should then have 
reported its conclusions to Cabinet before its members were asked to endorse the 
Government’s policy.

# Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer of 17 March 2003
478.  In Parliament during the second week of March, and in the media, there were calls 
on the Government to make a statement about its legal position.

479.  When Lord Goldsmith spoke to Mr Brummell on 13 March, they agreed that a 
statement should be prepared “setting out the Attorney’s view of the legal position which 
could be deployed at Cabinet and in Parliament the following week”. 

480.  The message was conveyed to No.10 during the morning of 15 March that Lord 
Goldsmith “would make clear during the course of the week that there is a sound legal 
basis for action should that prove necessary”.


481.  The decision that Lord Goldsmith would take the lead in explaining the 
Government’s legal position to Parliament, rather than the Prime Minister or responsible 
Secretary of State providing that explanation, was unusual. 

482.  The normal practice was, and is, that the Minister responsible for the policy, in this 
case Mr Blair or Mr Straw, would have made such a statement. 

# Cabinet, 17 March 2003
483.  Cabinet was provided with the text of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to Baroness 
Ramsey of Cartvale setting out the legal basis for military action. 

484.  That document represented a statement of the Government’s legal position – 
it did not explain the legal basis of the conclusion that Iraq had failed to take “the final 
opportunity” to comply with its disarmament obligations offered by resolution 1441. 

485.  Lord Goldsmith told Cabinet that it was “plain” that Iraq had failed to comply with 
its obligations and continued to be in “material breach” of the relevant Security Council 
resolutions. The authority to use force under resolution 678 was, “as a result”, revived. 
Lord Goldsmith said that there was no need for a further resolution. 

486.  Cabinet was not provided with written advice which set out, as the advice of 
7 March had done, the conflicting arguments regarding the legal effect of resolution 1441 
and whether, in particular, it authorised military action without a further resolution of the 
Security Council.

487.  Cabinet was not provided with, or informed of, Mr Brummell’s letter to Mr Rycroft 
of 14 March; or Mr Rycroft’s response of 15 March. Cabinet was not told how Mr Blair 
had reached the view recorded in Mr Rycroft’s letter. 

488.  The majority of Cabinet members who gave evidence to the Inquiry took the 
position that the role of the Attorney General on 17 March was, simply, to tell Cabinet 
whether or not there was a legal basis for military action. 

489.  None of those Ministers who had read Lord Goldsmith’s 7 March advice asked 
for an explanation as to why his legal view of resolution 1441 had changed. 

490.  There was little appetite to question Lord Goldsmith about his advice, and 
no substantive discussion of the legal issues was recorded. 

491.  Cabinet was not misled on 17 March and the exchange of letters between 
the Attorney General’s office and No.10 on 14 and 15 March did not constitute, 
as suggested to the Inquiry by Ms Short, a “side deal”.

492.  Cabinet was, however, being asked to confirm the decision that the diplomatic 
process was at an end and that the House of Commons should be asked to endorse 
the use of military action to enforce Iraq’s compliance. Given the gravity of this decision, 
Cabinet should have been made aware of the legal uncertainties.

493.  Lord Goldsmith should have been asked to provide written advice which fully 
reflected the position on 17 March, explained the legal basis on which the UK could take 
military action and set out the risks of legal challenge.

494.  The advice should have addressed the significance of the exchange of letters of 
14 and 15 March and how, in the absence of agreement from the majority of members 
of the Security Council, the point had been reached that Iraq had failed to take the final 
opportunity offered by resolution 1441. 

495.  The advice should have been provided to Ministers and senior officials whose 
responsibilities were directly engaged and should have been made available to Cabinet. 

# Weapons of mass destruction

## Iraq WMD assessments, pre‑July 2002
496.  The ingrained belief that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and 
biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible enhance its 
capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and was pursuing 
an active policy of deception and concealment, had underpinned UK policy towards Iraq 
since the Gulf Conflict ended in 1991. 

497.  While the detail of individual JIC Assessments on Iraq varied, this core construct 
remained in place. 

498.  Security Council resolutions adopted since 1991 demanded Iraq’s disarmament 
and the re‑admission of inspectors, and imposed sanctions in the absence of Iraqi 
compliance with those – and other – obligations. Agreement to those resolutions 
indicated that doubts about whether Iraq had disarmed were widely shared.

499.  In parallel, by 2000, the wider risk of proliferation was regarded as a major threat. 
There was heightened concern about:

nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; and 

*  the danger of proliferation, particularly that countries of concern might obtain 
*  the potential risk that terrorist groups which were willing to use them might gain 
access to chemical and biological agents and, possibly, nuclear material, and 
the means to deliver them.

500.  These concerns were reinforced after 9/11. 

501.  The view conveyed in JIC Assessments between December 2000 and March 
2002 was that, despite the considerable achievements of UNSCOM and the IAEA 
between 1991 and December 1998, including dismantling Iraq’s nuclear programme, 


the inspectors had been unable to account for some of the ballistic missiles and 
chemical and biological weapons and material produced by Iraq; and that it had:
*  not totally destroyed all its stockpile of chemical and biological weapons;
*  retained up to 360 tonnes of chemical agents and precursor chemicals and 
growth media which would allow it to produce more chemical and biological 
agents;

*  hidden a small number of long‑range Al Hussein ballistic missiles; and 
*  retained the knowledge, documentation and personnel which would allow it to 
reconstitute its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. 

502.  The JIC also judged that, since the departure of the weapons inspectors, Iraq: 

*  was actively pursuing programmes to extend the range of its existing 
short‑range ballistic missiles beyond the permitted range of 150km;
*  had begun development of a ballistic missile with a range greater than 1,000km;
*  was capable of resuming undetected production of “significant quantities” of 
chemical and biological agents, and in the case of VX (a nerve agent) might 
have already done so; and 

*  was pursuing activities that could be linked to a nuclear programme.

503.  Iraq’s chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes were seen as a threat 
to international peace and security in the Middle East region, but Iraq was viewed as 
a less serious proliferation threat than other key countries of concern – Iran, Libya and 
North Korea – which had current nuclear programmes. Iraq’s nuclear facilities had been 
dismantled by the weapons inspectors. The JIC judged that Iraq would be unable to 
obtain a nuclear weapon while sanctions remained effective.

504.  The JIC continued to judge that co‑operation between Iraq and Al Qaida was 
“unlikely”, and that there was no “credible evidence of Iraqi transfers of WMD‑related 
technology and expertise to terrorist groups”. 

505.  In mid‑February 2002, in preparation for Mr Blair’s planned meeting with President 
Bush in early April 2002, No.10 commissioned the preparation of a paper to inform the 
public about the dangers of nuclear proliferation and WMD more generally in four key 
countries of concern, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Iraq.

506.  When the preparation of this document became public knowledge, it was perceived 
to be intended to underpin a decision on military action against Iraq. The content and 
timing became a sensitive issue.

507.  Reflecting the UK position that action was needed to disarm Iraq, Mr Blair and 
Mr Straw began, from late February 2002, publicly to argue that Iraq was a threat which 
had to be dealt with; that Iraq needed to disarm or be disarmed in accordance with the 

obligations imposed by the UN; and that it was important to agree to the return of UN 
inspectors to Iraq. 

508.  The focus on Iraq was not the result of a step change in Iraq’s capabilities 
or intentions.

509.  When he saw the draft paper on WMD countries of concern on 8 March, Mr Straw 
commented:

“Good, but should not Iraq be first and also have more text? The paper has to show 
why there is an exceptional threat from Iraq. It does not quite do this yet.”200

510.  On 18 March, Mr Straw decided that a paper on Iraq should be issued before one 
addressing other countries of concern.

511.  On 22 March, Mr Straw was advised that the evidence would not convince public 
opinion that there was an imminent threat from Iraq. Publication was postponed.

512.  No.10 decided that the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat should 
co‑ordinate the production of a “public dossier” on Iraq, and that Mr Campbell should 
“retain the lead role on the timing/form of its release”.

513.  The statements prepared for, and used by, the UK Government in public, from 
late 2001 onwards, about Iraq’s proscribed activities and the potential threat they posed 
were understandably written in more direct and less nuanced language than the JIC 
Assessments on which they drew. 

514.  The question is whether, in doing so, they conveyed more certainty and knowledge 
than was justified, or created tests it would be impossible for Iraq to meet. That is of 
particular concern in relation to the evidence in Section 4.1 on two key issues.

515.  First, the estimates of the weapons and material related to Iraq’s chemical and 
biological warfare programmes for which UNSCOM had been unable to account were 
based on extrapolations from UNSCOM records. Officials explicitly advised that it was 
“inherently difficult to arrive at precise figures”. In addition, it was acknowledged that 
neither UNSCOM nor the UK could be certain about either exactly what had existed 
or what Iraq had already destroyed.

516.  The revised estimates announced by Mr Straw on 2 May were increasingly 
presented in Government statements as the benchmark against which Iraq should 
be judged.

517.  Second, the expert MOD examination of issues in late March 2002 exposed the 
difficulties Iraq would have to overcome before it could acquire a nuclear weapon. 
That included the difficulty of acquiring suitable fissile material from the “black market”.

200 Minute McDonald to Ricketts, 11 March 2002, ‘Iraq’. 


518.  In addition, the tendency to refer in public statements only to Iraq’s “weapons 
of mass destruction” without addressing their nature (the type of warhead and whether 
they were battlefield or strategic weapons systems) or how they might be used (as a 
last resort against invading military forces or as a weapon of terror to threaten civilian 
populations in other countries) was likely to have created the impression that Iraq posed 
a greater threat than the detailed JIC Assessments would have supported. 

## Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002
519.  From late February 2002, the UK Government position was that Iraq was a threat 
that had to be dealt with; that Iraq needed to disarm in accordance with the obligations 
imposed by the UN; and that it was important to agree to the return of UN inspectors 
to Iraq. 

520.  The urgency and certainty with which the position was stated reflected both the 
ingrained beliefs already described and the wider context in which the policy was being 
discussed with the US.

521.  But it also served to fuel the demand that the Government should publish the 
document it was known to have prepared, setting out the reasons why it was so 
concerned about Iraq.

522.  In the spring and summer of 2002, senior officials and Ministers took the view that 
the Iraq dossier should not be published until the way ahead on the policy was clearer. 

523.  By late August 2002, the Government was troubled by intense speculation about 
whether a decision had already been taken to use military force. In Mr Blair’s words, the 
US and UK had been “outed” as having taken a decision when no such decision had 
been taken. 

524.  Mr Blair’s decision on 3 September to announce that the dossier would be 
published was a response to that pressure. 

525.  The dossier was designed to “make the case” and secure Parliamentary (and 
public) support for the Government’s position that action was urgently required to secure 
Iraq’s disarmament.

526.  The UK Government intended the information and judgements in the Iraq dossier 
to be seen to be the product of the JIC in order to carry authority with Parliament and 
the public. 

527.  The Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) was commissioned by No.10 on 5 September 
to examine whether it had any additional material which could be included. 

528.  Mr Scarlett, as Chairman of the JIC, was given the responsibility of producing 
the dossier.

529.  The dossier drew on the 9 September JIC Assessment, ‘Iraqi Use of Chemical and 
Biological Weapons – Possible Scenarios’, which had been commissioned to address 
scenarios for Iraq’s possible use of chemical and biological weapons in the event of 
military action, previous JIC Assessments and the subsequent report issued by SIS 
on 11 September. 

530.  The SIS report should have been shown to the relevant experts in the Defence 
Intelligence Staff (DIS) who could have advised their senior managers and the 
Assessments Staff. 

531.  Expert officials in DIS questioned the certainty with which some of the judgements 
in the dossier were expressed. Some of their questions were discussed during the 
preparation of the dossier. The text was agreed by Air Marshal Joe French, Chief of 
Defence Intelligence, at the JIC meeting on 19 September.

532.  There is no evidence that other members of the JIC were aware at the time of the 
reservations recorded in the minute by Dr Brian Jones (the branch head of the nuclear, 
biological and chemical section in the Scientific and Technical Directorate of the Defence 
Intelligence Staff) of 19 September and that written by the chemical weapons expert in 
his team the following day. 

533.  The JIC accepted ownership of the dossier and agreed its content. There is 
no evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No.10 
improperly influenced the text. 

534.  At issue are the judgements made by the JIC and how they and the intelligence 
were presented, including in Mr Blair’s Foreword and in his statement to Parliament 
on 24 September 2002.

535.  It is unlikely that Parliament and the public would have distinguished between 
the ownership and therefore the authority of the judgements in the Foreword and those 
in the Executive Summary and the main body of the dossier.

536.  In the Foreword, Mr Blair stated that he believed the “assessed intelligence” had 
“established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein had “continued to produce chemical 
and biological weapons, that he continues in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons, 
and that he had been able to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme”. 
That raises two key questions.

*  Did Mr Blair’s statements in whole or in part go further than the assessed 
*  Did that matter?

intelligence? 

537.  The Inquiry is not questioning Mr Blair’s belief, which he consistently reiterated 
in his evidence to the Inquiry, or his legitimate role in advocating Government policy. 


538.  But the deliberate selection of a formulation which grounded the statement in what 
Mr Blair believed, rather than in the judgements which the JIC had actually reached in its 
assessment of the intelligence, indicates a distinction between his beliefs and the JIC’s 
actual judgements.

539.  That is supported by the position taken by the JIC and No.10 officials at the time, 
and in the evidence offered to the Inquiry by some of those involved.

540.  The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt that Saddam Hussein 
had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons. The Executive Summary 
of the dossier stated that the JIC judged that Iraq had “continued to produce chemical 
and biological agents”. The main text of the dossier said that there had been “recent” 
production. It also stated that Iraq had the means to deliver chemical and biological 
weapons. It did not say that Iraq had continued to produce weapons. 

541.  Nor had the assessed intelligence established beyond doubt that efforts to develop 
nuclear weapons continued. The JIC stated in the Executive Summary of the dossier 
that Iraq had:

in the production of nuclear weapons”; 

*  made covert attempts “to acquire technology and materials which could be used 
*  “sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa, despite having no active 
*  “recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme”.

nuclear programme that would require it”; and 

542.  But the dossier made clear that, as long as sanctions remained effective, Iraq 
could not produce a nuclear weapon.

543.  These conclusions draw on the evidence from the JIC Assessments at the time 
and the Executive Summary of the dossier, which are set out in Section 4.2. They do 
not rely on hindsight. 

544.  The JIC itself should have made that position clear because its ownership of the 
dossier, which was intended to inform a highly controversial policy debate, carried with 
it the responsibility to ensure that the JIC’s integrity was protected. 

545.  The process of seeking the JIC’s views, through Mr Scarlett, on the text of the 
Foreword shows that No.10 expected the JIC to raise any concerns it had.

546.  The firmness of Mr Blair’s beliefs, despite the underlying uncertainties, is important 
in considering how the judgements in the Foreword would have been interpreted by 
Cabinet in its discussions on 23 September and by Parliament.

547.  In his statement to Parliament on 24 September and in his answers to subsequent 
questions, Mr Blair presented Iraq’s past, current and potential future capabilities as 
evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction; 
and that, at some point in the future, that threat would become a reality. 

548.  By the time the dossier was published, President Bush had announced that 
the US was seeking action on Iraq through the UN, and Iraq had agreed to the return 
of inspectors. 

549.  Rather than the debate being framed in terms of the answers needed to the 
outstanding questions identified by UNSCOM and the IAEA, including the material 
for which UNSCOM had been unable to account, the dossier’s description of Iraq’s 
capabilities and intent became part of the baseline against which the UK Government 
measured Iraq’s future statements and actions and the success of weapons inspections.

550.  As Section 4.3 demonstrates, the judgements remained in place without challenge 
until the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Iraq’s denials of the capabilities and intent 
attributed to it were not taken seriously.

551.  As the flaws in the construct and the intelligence were exposed after the conflict, 
the dossier and subsequent statements to Parliament also became the baseline against 
which the Government’s good faith and credibility were judged.

## Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003
552.  From October 2002 onwards, the JIC focused on two main themes:

compliance with the specific obligations imposed by resolution 1441; and 

*  Iraq’s attitude to the return of the inspectors and, from 8 November, its 
*  Iraq’s options, diplomatic and military, including the possible use of chemical and 
biological weapons and ballistic missiles against Coalition Forces or countries in 
the region in either pre‑emptive attacks or in response to a military attack.

553.  In its Assessment of 18 December, the JIC made the judgements in the UK 
Government September dossier part of the test for Iraq. 

554.  The judgements about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions relied heavily on Iraq’s past 
behaviour being a reliable indicator of its current and future actions.

555.  There was no consideration of whether, faced with the prospect of a US‑led 
invasion, Saddam Hussein had taken a different position.

556.  The absence of evidence of proscribed programmes and materials relating to the 
production or delivery of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons was attributed to Iraq’s 
ability to conceal its activities and deceive the inspectors and the difficulties which it had 
been anticipated the inspectors would encounter.

557.  The JIC Assessment of 11 October 2002 stated that a good intelligence flow from 
inside Iraq, supporting tougher inspections, would be “central to success”. 

558.  A key element of the Assessments was the reporting and intelligence on Iraq’s 
intentions to conceal its activities, deceive the inspectors and obstruct the conduct of 
inspections, particularly Iraq’s attitudes to preventing interviews with officials who were 


identified as associated with its proscribed programmes or who had been involved 
in Iraq’s unilateral destruction of its weapons and facilities.

559.  The large number of intelligence reports about Iraq’s activities were interpreted 
from the perspective that Iraq’s objectives were to conceal its programmes. 

560.  Similarly, Iraq’s actions were consistently interpreted as indicative of deceit. 

561.  From early 2003, the Government drew heavily on the intelligence reporting of 
Iraq’s activities to deceive and obstruct the inspectors to illustrate its conclusion that 
Iraq had no intention of complying with the obligations imposed in resolution 1441.

562.  The Government also emphasised the reliability of the reporting.

563.  The JIC’s judgement from August 2002 until 19 March 2003 remained that Iraq 
might use chemical and biological weapons in response to a military attack. 

564.  Iraq’s statements that it had no weapons or programmes were dismissed as further 
evidence of a strategy of denial. 

565.  In addition, the extent to which the JIC’s judgements depended on inference and 
interpretation of Iraq’s previous attitudes and behaviour was not recognised.

566.  At no stage was the hypothesis that Iraq might not have chemical, biological 
or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either the JIC or the 
policy community.

567.  After its 9 September 2002 Assessment, the JIC was not asked to review its 
judgements on Iraq’s capabilities and programmes which underpinned UK thinking. 
Nor did the JIC itself suggest such a review. 

568.  As a result there was no formal reassessment of the JIC judgements, and the 
9 September Assessment and the 24 September dossier provided part of the baseline 
for the UK Government’s view of Iraq’s capabilities and intentions on its chemical, 
biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

569.  Given the weight which rested on the JIC’s judgements about Iraq’s possession 
of WMD and its future intent for the decision in March that military action should, if 
necessary, be taken to disarm Iraq, a formal reassessment of the JIC’s judgements 
should have taken place. 

570.  This might have been prompted by Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council on 
14 February 2003, which demonstrated the developing divergence between the 
assessments presented by the US and UK. Dr Blix’s report of 7 March, which changed 
the view that Iraqi behaviour was preventing UNMOVIC from carrying out its tasks, 
should certainly have prompted a review.

# The search for WMD
571.  Section 4.4 considers the impact of the failure to find stockpiles of WMD in Iraq 
in the months immediately after the invasion, and of the emerging conclusions of the 
Iraq Survey Group (ISG), on: 

*  the Government’s response to demands for an independent judge‑led inquiry 
*  the Government’s public presentation of the nature of the threat from Saddam 

into pre‑conflict intelligence on Iraq; and

Hussein’s regime and the decision to go to war.

572.  The Inquiry has not sought to comment in detail on the specific conclusions of the 
ISC, FAC, Hutton and Butler Reports, all of which were published before the withdrawal 
by SIS in September 2004 of a significant proportion of the intelligence underpinning the 
JIC Assessments and September 2002 dossier on which UK policy had rested. 

573.  In addition to the conclusions of those reports, the Inquiry notes the forthright 
statement in March 2005 of the US Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the 
United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction. Reporting to President Bush, 
the Commission stated that “the [US] Intelligence Community was dead wrong in almost 
all of its pre‑war judgments about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. This was a major 
intelligence failure.”

574.  The evidence in Section 4.4 shows that, after the invasion, the UK Government, 
including the intelligence community, was reluctant to admit, and to recognise publicly, 
the mounting evidence that there had been failings in the UK’s pre‑conflict collection, 
validation, analysis and presentation of intelligence on Iraq’s WMD. 

575.  Despite the failure to identify any evidence of WMD programmes during pre‑conflict 
inspections, the UK Government remained confident that evidence would be found after 
the Iraqi regime had been removed.

576.  Almost immediately after the start of the invasion, UK Ministers and officials sought 
to lower public expectations of immediate or significant finds of WMD in Iraq. 

577.  The lack of evidence to support pre‑conflict claims about Iraq’s WMD challenged 
the credibility of the Government and the intelligence community, and the legitimacy 
of the war. 

578.  The Government and the intelligence community were both concerned about 
the consequences of the presentational aspects of their pre‑war assessments 
being discredited.

579.  By June, the Government had acknowledged the need for a review of the UK’s 
pre‑conflict intelligence on Iraq. It responded to demands for an independent, judge‑led 
inquiry by expressing support for the reviews initiated by the ISC and the FAC. 


580.  The announcement of the Hutton Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the 
death of Dr David Kelly on 18 July, reinforced the Government’s position that additional 
reviews were not needed. 

581.  The Government maintained that position until January 2004, backed by three 
votes in the House of Commons (on 4 June, 15 July and 22 October 2003) rejecting 
a succession of Opposition motions calling for an independent inquiry into the use of 
pre‑war intelligence. 

582.  Mr Blair’s initial response to growing criticism of the failure to find WMD was 
to counsel patience.

583.  After the publication of the ISG Interim Report, the Government’s focus shifted 
from finding stockpiles of weapons to emphasising evidence of the Iraqi regime’s 
strategic intent. 

584.  Once President Bush made clear his decision to set up an independent inquiry, 
Mr Blair’s resistance to a public inquiry became untenable.

585.  After the announcement of the Butler Review, the UK Government’s focus shifted 
to the content of the next ISG report, the Status Report.

586.  The Government, still concerned about the nature of the public debate on WMD 
in the UK, sought to ensure that the Status Report included existing ISG material 
highlighting the strategic intentions of Saddam Hussein’s regime and breaches of 
Security Council resolutions. 

587.  Mr Blair remained concerned about continuing public and Parliamentary criticism 
of the pre‑conflict intelligence, the failure to find WMD and the decision to invade Iraq. 
After the reports from the Hutton Inquiry, the ISG and the US Commission, he sought 
to demonstrate that, although “the exact basis for action was not as we thought”, the 
invasion had still been justified. 

588.  The ISG’s findings were significant, but did not support past statements by the UK 
and US Governments, which had focused on Iraq’s current capabilities and an urgent 
and growing threat.

589.  The explanation for military action put forward by Mr Blair in October 2004 was 
not the one given before the conflict. 

# Planning for a post‑Saddam Hussein Iraq

# The failure to plan or prepare for known risks
590.  The information on Iraq available to the UK Government before the invasion 
provided a clear indication of the potential scale of the post‑conflict task.

591.  It showed that, in order to achieve the UK’s desired end state, any post‑conflict 
administration would need to:

*  restore infrastructure that had deteriorated significantly in the decade since 
1991, to the point where it was not capable of meeting the needs of the Iraqi 
people;

*  administer a state where the upper echelons of a regime that had been in power 
since 1968 had been abruptly removed and in which the capabilities of the wider 
civil administration, many of whose employees were members of the ruling party, 
were difficult to assess; and

*  provide security in a country faced with a number of potential threats, including:

 * internecine violence;
 * terrorism; and 
 * Iranian interference. 

592.  In December 2002, the MOD described the post‑conflict phase of operations as 
“strategically decisive”.201 But when the invasion began, the UK Government was not 
in a position to conclude that satisfactory plans had been drawn up and preparations 
made to meet known post‑conflict challenges and risks in Iraq and to mitigate the risk 
of strategic failure.

593.  Throughout the planning process, the UK assumed that the US would be 
responsible for preparing the post‑conflict plan, that post‑conflict activity would be 
authorised by the UN Security Council, that agreement would be reached on a 
significant post‑conflict role for the UN and that international partners would step forward 
to share the post‑conflict burden. 

594.  On that basis, the UK planned to reduce its military contribution in Iraq to medium 
scale within four months of the start of the invasion202 and expected not to have to make 
a substantial commitment to post‑conflict administration.203

595.  Achieving that outcome depended on the UK’s ability to persuade the US of the 
merits of a significant post‑conflict role for the UN. 

596.  The UK could not be certain at any stage in the year before the invasion that 
it would succeed in that aim.

597.  In January 2003, the UK sought to persuade the US of the benefits of UN 
leadership of Iraq’s interim post‑conflict civil administration.204 Officials warned that,

if the UK failed to persuade the US, it risked “being drawn into a huge commitment 
of UK resources for a highly complex task of administration and law and order for 
an uncertain period”. 

598.  By March 2003, having failed to persuade the US of the advantages of a UN‑led 
interim administration, the UK had set the less ambitious goal of persuading the US to 
accept UN authorisation of a Coalition‑led interim administration and an international 
presence that would include the UN.205

599.  On 19 March, Mr Blair stated in Parliament that discussions were taking place with 
the US, UN and others on the role of the UN and post‑conflict issues.206 

600.  Discussions continued, but, as the invasion began: 

*  The UK had not secured US agreement to a Security Council resolution 

authorising post‑conflict administration and could not be sure when, or on what 
terms, agreement would be possible. 

*  The extent of the UN’s preparations, which had been hindered by the absence 

of agreement on post‑conflict arrangements, remained uncertain. Mr Annan 
emphasised to Ms Short the need for clarity on US thinking so that UN planning 
could proceed207 and told Sir Jeremy Greenstock that he “would not wish to see 
any arrangement subjugating UN activity to Coalition activity”.208 

*  Potential international partners for reconstruction and additional Coalition 

partners to provide security continued to make their post‑conflict contributions 
conditional on UN authorisation for Phase IV (the military term for post‑conflict 
operations).209

601.  Despite being aware of the shortcomings of the US plan,210 strong US resistance 
to a leading role for the UN,211 indications that the UN did not want the administration 
of Iraq to become its responsibility212 and a warning about the tainted image of the UN 
in Iraq,213 at no stage did the UK Government formally consider other policy options, 
including the possibility of making participation in military action conditional on a 
satisfactory plan for the post‑conflict period, or how to mitigate the known risk that 
the UK could find itself drawn into a “huge commitment of UK resources” for which 
no contingency preparations had been made.

# The planning process and decision‑making
602.  As a junior partner in the Coalition, the UK worked within a planning framework 
established by the US. It had limited influence over a process dominated increasingly 
by the US military.

603.  The creation of the Ad Hoc Group on Iraq in September 2002 and the Iraq Planning 
Unit in February 2003 improved co‑ordination across government at official level, but 
neither body carried sufficient authority to establish a unified planning process across 
the four principal departments involved – the FCO, the MOD, DFID and the Treasury – 
or between military and civilian planners. 

604.  Important material, including in the DFID reviews of northern and southern Iraq, 
and significant pieces of analysis, including the series of MOD Strategic Planning 
Group (SPG) papers on military strategic thinking, were either not shared outside the 
originating department, or, as appears to have been the case with the SPG papers, were 
not routinely available to all those with a direct interest in the contents. 

605.  Some risks were identified, but departmental ownership of those risks, and 
responsibility for analysis and mitigation, were not clearly established. 

606.  When the need to plan and prepare for the worst case was raised, including by 
MOD officials in advice to Mr Hoon on 6 March 2003,214 Lieutenant General John Reith, 
Chief of Joint Operations, in his paper for the Chiefs of Staff on 21 March215 and in 
Treasury advice to Mr Brown on 24 March,216 there is no evidence that any department 
or individual assumed ownership or was assigned responsibility for analysis or 
mitigation. No action ensued. 

607.  In April 2003, Mr Blair set up the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation 
(AHMGIR), chaired by Mr Straw, to oversee the UK contribution to post‑conflict 
reconstruction.

608.  Until the creation of the AHMGIR, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Ms Short remained 
jointly responsible for directing post‑conflict planning and preparation. 

609.  In the absence of a single person responsible for overseeing all aspects 
of planning and preparation, departments pursued complementary, but separate, 
objectives. Gaps in UK capabilities were overlooked. 

610.  The FCO, which focused on policy‑making and negotiation, was not equipped by 
past experience or practice, or by its limited human and financial resources, to prepare 
for nation‑building of the scale required in Iraq, and did not expect to do so.

Term UK Military Commitment’.

216 Minute Dodds to Chancellor, 24 March 2003, ‘Iraq: UK Military Contribution to Post‑Conflict Iraq’. 


611.  DFID’s focus on poverty reduction and the channelling of assistance through 
multilateral institutions instilled a reluctance, before the invasion, to engage on anything 
other than the immediate humanitarian response to conflict. 

612.  When military planners advised of the need to consider the civilian component as 
an integral part of the UK’s post‑conflict deployment, the Government was not equipped 
to respond. Neither the FCO nor DFID took responsibility for the issue.

613.  The shortage of expertise in reconstruction and stabilisation was a constraint 
on the planning process and on the contribution the UK was able to make to the 
administration and reconstruction of post‑conflict Iraq. 

614.  The UK Government’s post‑invasion response to the shortage of deployable 
experts in stabilisation and post‑conflict reconstruction is addressed in Section 10.3.

615.  Constraints on UK military capacity are addressed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.

616.  The UK contribution to the post‑conflict humanitarian response is assessed 
in Section 10.1.

617.  At no stage did Ministers or senior officials commission the systematic evaluation 
of different options, incorporating detailed analysis of risk and UK capabilities, military 
and civilian, which should have been required before the UK committed to any course 
of action in Iraq. 

618.  Where policy recommendations were supported by untested assumptions, those 
assumptions were seldom challenged. When they were, the issue was not always 
followed through.

619.  It was the responsibility of officials to identify, analyse and advise on risk and 
Ministers’ responsibility to ensure that measures to mitigate identifiable risks, including 
a range of policy options, had been considered before significant decisions were taken 
on the direction of UK policy. 

620.  Occasions when that would have been appropriate included:

*  after Mr Blair’s meeting with Mr Hoon, Mr Straw and others on 23 July 2002;
*  after the adoption of resolution 1441;
*  before or immediately after the decision to deploy troops in January 2003; 
*  after the Rock Drill (a US inter‑agency rehearsal for post‑conflict administration) 
*  after Mr Blair’s meeting on post‑conflict issues on 6 March 2003.

in February 2003; and 

621.  There is no indication of formal risk analysis or formal consideration of options 
associated with any of those events. 

622.  In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Blair said:

“... with hindsight, we now see that the military campaign to defeat Saddam was 
relatively easy; it was the aftermath that was hard. At the time, of course, we could 
not know that and a prime focus throughout was the military campaign itself …”217

623.  The conclusions reached by Mr Blair after the invasion did not require the benefit 
of hindsight. 

624.  Mr Blair’s long‑standing conviction that successful international intervention 
required long‑term commitment had been clearly expressed in his Chicago speech 
in 1999. 

625.  That conviction was echoed, in the context of Iraq, in frequent advice to Mr Blair 
from Ministers and officials.

626.  Between early 2002 and the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Mr Blair received 
warnings about:

*  the significance of the post‑conflict phase as the “strategically decisive” 

phase of the engagement in Iraq (in the SPG paper of 13 December 2002218) 
and the risk that a badly handled aftermath would make intervention a “net 
failure” (in the letter from Mr Hoon’s Private Office to Sir David Manning of 
19 November 2002219);

*  the likelihood of internal conflict in Iraq (including from Mr Powell on 

26 September 2002, who warned of the need to stop “a terrible bloodletting 
of revenge after Saddam goes. Traditional in Iraq after conflict”220);

*  the potential scale of the political, social, economic and security challenge 
(including from Sir Christopher Meyer (British Ambassador to the US) on 
6 September 2002: “it will probably make pacifying Afghanistan look like 
child’s play”221); 

*  the need for an analysis of whether the benefits of military action outweighed the 
risk of a protracted and costly nation‑building exercise (including from Mr Straw 
on 8 July 2002: the US “must also understand that we are serious about our 
conditions for UK involvement”222);

*  the absence of credible US plans for the immediate post‑conflict period and 
the subsequent reconstruction of Iraq (including from the British Embassy

planning is at a very rudimentary stage”223); 

*  the need to agree with the US the nature of the UK contribution to those plans 
(including in the letter from Mr Hoon’s Private Office to Sir David Manning on 
28 February 2003: it was “absolutely clear” that the US expected the UK to take 
leadership of the South‑East sector. The UK was “currently at risk of taking on 
a very substantial commitment that we will have great difficulty in sustaining 
beyond the immediate conclusion of conflict”224); and 

*  the importance (including in the ‘UK overall plan for Phase IV’, shown to Mr Blair 

on 7 March 2003225) of:

 * UN authorisation for the military occupation of Iraq, without which there 

would be no legal cover for certain post‑conflict tasks;

 * a UN framework for the administration and reconstruction of Iraq during the 

transition to Iraqi self‑government.

627.  Mr Blair told the Chiefs of Staff on 15 January 2003 that “the ‘Issue’ was aftermath 
– the Coalition must prevent anarchy and internecine fighting breaking out”.226 

628.  In his evidence to the House of Commons Liaison Committee on 21 January 2003, 
Mr Blair emphasised the importance of the post‑conflict phase:

“You do not engage in military conflict that may produce regime change unless you 
are prepared to follow through and work in the aftermath of that regime change to 
ensure the country is stable and the people are properly looked after.”227

629.  On 24 January 2003, Mr Blair told President Bush that the biggest risk they faced 
was internecine fighting, and that delay would allow time for working up more coherent 
post‑conflict plans.228

630.  Yet when Mr Blair set out the UK’s vision for the future of Iraq in the House of 
Commons on 18 March 2003, no assessment had been made of whether that vision 
was achievable, no agreement had been reached with the US on a workable post‑conflict 
plan, UN authorisation had not yet been secured, and there had been no decision on 
the UN’s role in post‑conflict Iraq.

631.  UK policy rested on the assumption that:

in Iraq;

*  the US would provide effective leadership of the immediate post‑conflict effort 
*  the conditions would soon be in place for UK military withdrawal; 
*  after a short period of US‑led, UN‑authorised military occupation, the UN would 
administer and provide a framework for the reconstruction of post‑conflict Iraq; 
*  substantial international support would follow UN authorisation; and
*  reconstruction and the political transition to Iraqi rule would proceed in a secure 

environment. 

632.  Mr Blair was already aware that those assumptions concealed significant risks:

*  UK officials assessed that the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian 
Assistance (ORHA), the US body that would assume responsibility for the 
immediate post‑invasion administration of Iraq, was not up to the task.
*  Significant differences remained between UK and US positions on UN 
*  International partners were scarce and thought to be unlikely to come forward 
*  UK officials recognised that occupying forces would not remain welcome for long 

involvement, and between the UK and the UN.

in the absence of UN authorisation.

and threats to security could quickly escalate. 

633.  In the year before the invasion, Mr Blair: 

*  stated his belief in the importance of post‑conflict planning on several occasions, 
*  requested advice on aspects of post‑conflict Iraq (including for his summer 

including in Cabinet, in Parliament and with President Bush;

reading pack in July 2002, for his meeting with President Bush on 31 January 
2003, and twice in February 2003 after reading the JIC Assessment of southern 
Iraq and the Adelphi Paper Iraq at the Crossroads);

*  at the meeting with Mr Hoon and the Chiefs of Staff on 15 January 2003, 
asked the MOD to consider the “big ‘what ifs’” in the specific context of the 
UK military plan;

*  convened a Ministerial meeting on post‑conflict issues on 6 March 2003;
*  raised concerns about the state of planning with President Bush; and
*  succeeded in the narrow goal of securing President Bush’s agreement that 
the UN should be “heavily involved” in “the post‑conflict situation”, a loose 
formulation that appeared to bridge the gap between US and UK positions 
on UN authorisation and the post‑conflict role of the UN, but did not address 
the substantive issues.


634.  Mr Blair did not:

preparation;

*  establish clear Ministerial oversight of post‑conflict strategy, planning and 
*  ensure that Ministers took the decisions needed to prepare a flexible, realistic 
and fully resourced plan integrating UK military and civilian contributions;
*  seek adequate assurances that the UK was in a position to meet its likely 
*  insist that the UK’s strategic objectives for Iraq were tested against 

obligations in Iraq;

anything other than the best case: a well‑planned and executed US‑led and 
UN‑authorised post‑conflict operation in a relatively benign security environment;

*  press President Bush for definitive assurances about US post‑conflict plans 
or set out clearly to him the strategic risk in underestimating the post‑conflict 
challenge and failing adequately to prepare for the task; or

*  consider, or seek advice on, whether the absence of a satisfactory plan was 
a sufficient threat to UK strategic objectives to require a reassessment of the 
terms of the UK engagement in Iraq. Despite concerns about the state of US 
planning, he did not make agreement on a satisfactory post‑conflict plan a 
condition of UK participation in military action.

635.  In the weeks immediately following the invasion, Mr Blair’s omissions made it more 
difficult for the UK Government to take an informed decision on the establishment of 
the UK’s post‑conflict Area of Responsibility (AOR) in southern Iraq (addressed in more 
detail in Section 8).

636.  In the short to medium term, his omissions increased the risk that the UK would 
be unable to respond to the unexpected in Iraq.

637.  In the longer term, they reduced the likelihood of achieving the UK’s strategic 
objectives in Iraq.

# The post‑conflict period

## Occupation

### LOOTING IN BASRA
638.  As described in Section 8, UK forces entered Basra City on the night of 6/7 April 
2003 and rapidly gained control, meeting less resistance than anticipated. Once 
the city was under its control, the UK was responsible, as the Occupying Power, for 
maintenance of law and order. Within its predominantly Shia Area of Operations, the 
UK assumed that risks to Coalition Forces would be lower than in the so‑called “Sunni 
triangle” controlled by the US.

639.  Before the invasion, the JIC and the DIS had each identified that there was a risk 
of lawlessness breaking out in Iraq, and that it would be important to deal with it swiftly. 
Others, including Mr Blair, Sir Kevin Tebbit and the Iraq Policy Unit, had recognised the 
seriousness of that risk.

640.  However, the formal authorisation for action in Iraq issued by Adm Boyce on 
18 March contained no instruction on how to establish a safe and secure environment if 
lawlessness broke out as anticipated. Although it was known that Phase IV would begin 
quickly, no Rules of Engagement for that phase, including for dealing with lawlessness, 
were created and promulgated before UK troops entered the country.

641.  Both before and during the invasion Lt Gen Reith made the absence of instructions 
to UK forces covering what to do if faced with lawless behaviour by the Iraqi population 
in Basra explicit to the Chiefs of Staff. 

642.  Faced with widespread looting after the invasion, and without instructions, UK 
commanders had to make their own judgements about what to do. Brigadier Graham 
Binns, commanding the 7 Armoured Brigade which had taken Basra City, told the Inquiry 
that he had concluded that “the best way to stop looting was just to get to a point where 
there was nothing left to loot”.229

643.  Although the implementation of tactical plans to deal with lawlessness was properly 
the responsibility of in‑theatre commanders, it was the responsibility of the Chief of the 
Defence Staff and the Chief of Joint Operations to ensure that appropriate Rules of 
Engagement were set, and preparations made, to equip commanders on the ground to 
deal with it effectively. They should have ensured that those steps were taken. 

644.  The impact of looting was felt primarily by the Iraqi population rather than by 
Coalition Forces. The latter initially experienced a “honeymoon period”,230 although 
the situation was far from stabilised. 

645.  Lt Gen Reith anticipated that UK forces could be reduced to a medium scale 
effort by the autumn, when he expected the campaign to have reached “some form 
of ‘steady‑state’”.231 

646.  The JIC correctly judged on 16 April that the local population had high hopes that 
the Coalition would rapidly improve their lives and that “resentment of the Coalition ... 
could grow quickly if it is seen to be ineffective, either politically or militarily. Such 
resentment could lead to violence.”232

232 JIC Assessment, 16 April 2003, ‘Iraq: The Initial Landscape Post‑Saddam’. 


647.  By the end of April, Mr Hoon had announced that UK troop levels would fall to 
between 25,000 and 30,000 by the middle of May, from an initial peak of around 46,000. 

648.  Consequently, by the start of May there was a clearly articulated expectation of a 
rapid drawdown of UK forces by the autumn despite the identified risk that the consent 
of the local population was built on potentially vulnerable foundations, which could be 
undermined rapidly and with serious consequences. 

### LOOTING IN BAGHDAD 
649.  In the absence of a functioning Iraqi police force and criminal justice system, 
and without a clear Coalition Phase IV plan, looting and score‑settling became a 
serious problem in Baghdad soon after the regime fell. The looting of ministry buildings 
and damage to state‑owned infrastructure in particular added to the challenges 
of the Occupation. 

650.  Reflecting in June 2004, Mr David Richmond, the Prime Minister’s Special 
Representative on Iraq from March to June 2004, judged that the failure to crack down 
on looting in Baghdad in April 2003 released “a crime wave which the Coalition has 
never been able to bring fully under control”.233

651.  After visiting Iraq in early May 2003, General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the 
General Staff, observed:

“A security vacuum still exists [in Baghdad] ... particularly at night. Looting, 
revenge killing and subversive activities are rife … Should a bloody and protracted 
insurgency establish itself in Baghdad, then a ripple effect is likely to occur.”234

652.  Gen Jackson recognised that the UK’s ability to maintain the consent of the 
population in the South depended on a stable and secure Baghdad, and advised:

“The bottom line is that if we choose not to influence Baghdad we must be confident 
of the US ability to improve [its tactics] before tolerance is lost and insurgency 
sets in.” 

653.  Gen Jackson, Major General David Richards (Assistant Chief of the General 
Staff) and Lieutenant General Sir Anthony Pigott (Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff 
(Commitments)) all offered advice in favour of deploying the UK’s 16 Air Assault Brigade 
to Baghdad to support Coalition efforts to retrain Iraqi police officers and get them back 
on patrol. 

654.  However, the Chiefs of Staff collectively considered that the benefits of making 
a contribution to the security of Baghdad were outweighed by the risk that UK troops 
would be “tied down” outside the UK’s Area of Responsibility, with adverse impact, and

advised on 21 May against deploying 16 Air Assault Brigade. The Chiefs of Staff did not 
conclude that the tasks it was proposed that 16 Air Assault Brigade should undertake 
were unnecessary, but rather that US troops would complete them.

## UK INFLUENCE ON POST‑INVASION STRATEGY: RESOLUTION 1483
655.  On 21 March 2003, the day after the start of the invasion, Mr Powell and Sir David 
Manning, two of Mr Blair’s closest advisers, offered him advice on how to influence the 
post‑invasion US agenda. Key among their concerns was the need for post‑conflict 
administrative arrangements to have the legitimacy conferred by UN endorsement. Such 
UK plans for the post‑conflict period as had been developed relied on the deployment of 
an international reconstruction effort to Iraq. Controversy surrounding the launch of the 
invasion made that challenging to deliver; the absence of UN endorsement would make 
it close to impossible. 

656.  Discussion between the US and UK on the content of a new UN Security Council 
resolution began the same day. Resolution 1483 (2003) was eventually adopted on 
22 May. 

657.  US and UK objectives for the resolution were different, and in several substantive 
respects the text of resolution 1483 differed from the UK’s preferred position. 

658.  The UK wanted oil revenues to be controlled by an Iraqi body, or failing that by the 
UN or World Bank, in line with the pre‑invasion promise to use them exclusively for the 
benefit of Iraq. Instead, resolution 1483 placed the power to spend the Development 
Fund for Iraq into the hands of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), overseen by a 
monitoring board. That was in line with US objectives, but did not address UK concerns. 

659.  The UK considered that an Interim Iraqi Administration should have real powers, 
and not be subordinate to the CPA. Resolution 1483 said that the CPA would retain 
its responsibilities until an internationally recognised representative government was 
established. The text did not go so far as to require an interim administration to report 
formally to the CPA, as the US wished, but that was in effect how the relationship 
between the CPA and the Governing Council established by resolution 1483 operated. 

660.  The UK’s policy position was that the UN should take the lead in establishing the 
Interim Iraqi Administration. Resolution 1483 gave the UN a role working with the people 
of Iraq and the CPA, but did not give it the lead. Evidence considered by the Inquiry 
suggests that there was consistent reluctance on the part of the UN to take on such a 
role and the UK position was therefore not wholly realistic. 

661.  Resolution 1483 formally designated the UK and US as joint Occupying Powers 
in Iraq. It also set the conditions for the CPA’s dominance over post‑invasion strategy 
and policy by handing it control of funding for reconstruction and influence on political 
development at least equal to that of the UN. 

## UK INFLUENCE ON THE COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY
662.  By the time resolution 1483 was adopted, the CPA was already operating in Iraq 
under the leadership of Ambassador L Paul Bremer, reporting to Mr Donald Rumsfeld, 
the US Defense Secretary. There was no reporting line from the CPA to the UK. 

663.  The resolution’s designation of the US and UK as joint Occupying Powers did not 
reflect the reality of the Occupation. The UK contribution to the CPA’s effort was much 
smaller than that of the US and was particularly concerned with Basra. 

664.  The UK took an early decision to concentrate its effort in one geographical area 
rather than accept a national lead for a particular element of the Coalition effort (such 
as police reform). However, it was inevitable that Iraq’s future would be determined 
in Baghdad, as both the administrative centre and the place where the power shift 
from minority Sunni rule to majority Shia rule was going to be most keenly felt. Having 
decided to concentrate its effort on an area some distance removed from the capital, 
the UK’s ability to influence policy under debate in Baghdad was curtailed. 

665.  In Baghdad itself, the UK provided only a small proportion of the staff for the 
military and civilian headquarters. The low numbers were influenced in part by 
reasonable concerns about the personal legal liabilities of UK staff working initially 
in ORHA and then in the CPA, and what their deployment might imply about the UK’s 
responsibility for decisions made by those organisations, in the absence of formal 
consultation or the right of veto. 

666.  The pre‑invasion focus on a leading UN role in Iraq meant that little thought 
had been given to the status of UK personnel during an occupation which followed 
an invasion without Security Council authorisation. Better planning, including proper 
assessment of a variety of different possible scenarios, would have allowed such issues 
to be worked through at a much earlier stage. 

667.  There was an urgent need for suitably experienced UK officials ready to deploy 
to Baghdad, but they had not been identified (see Section 15). 

668.  No governance arrangements were designed before the invasion which might 
have enabled officials and Ministers based in London and Washington to manage the 
implications of a joint occupation involving separate resources of a very different scale. 
Such arrangements would have provided a means to identify and resolve different 
perspectives on policy, and to facilitate joint decisions. 

669.  Once the CPA had been established, policy decisions were made largely 
in Baghdad, where there was also no formal US/UK governance structure. 
This created a risk described to the Inquiry by Sir Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser 
from 2001 to 2006, as “the UK being held jointly responsible for acts or omissions 
of the CPA, without a right to consult and a right of joint decision”.235 

235 Statement, 15 March 2011, page 22.

670.  To manage that risk, the UK proposed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
with the US to establish procedures for working together on issues related to the 
Occupation, but it could not be agreed. Having supplied the overwhelming majority of the 
CPA’s resources, the US had little incentive to give the UK an influential role in deciding 
how those resources were to be used, and the UK lacked the will and leverage to insist. 

671.  In the absence of formal arrangements, there was a clear risk that the UK would 
be inadequately involved in important decisions, and the UK struggled from the start 
to have a significant effect on the CPA’s policies. This was a source of concern to both 
Ministers and officials in 2003, but the issue was never resolved. 

672.  Senior individuals deployed to Iraq by the UK at this time saw themselves either 
as working for the CPA in support of its objectives and as part of its chain of command, 
or as UK representatives within the CPA with a remit to seek to influence CPA decisions. 
No‑one formally represented the UK position within the CPA decision‑making process, 
a serious weakness which should have been addressed at an early stage. 

673.  Managing a joint occupation of such size and complexity effectively and coherently 
required regular formal and informal discussion and clear decision‑making at all levels, 
both between capitals and in‑country. Once attempts to agree an MOU had failed, the 
chances of constructing such mechanisms were slim. 

674.  In the absence of an MOU with the US, the UK’s influence in Baghdad 
depended heavily on the personal impact of successive Special Representatives and 
British Ambassadors to Iraq and the relationships they were able to build with senior 
US figures. 

675.  Some instances of important CPA decisions in which the UK played little 
or no formal part were:

*  The decision to issue CPA Order No.2, which “dissolved” (or disbanded) a 
number of military and other security entities that had operated as part of 
Saddam Hussein’s regime, including the armed forces (see Section 12). This 
was raised informally by Ambassador Bremer in his first meeting with Mr John 
Sawers, Mr Blair’s Special Representative on Iraq, who – unbriefed – did not at 
that point take a contrary position. The concept of creating a new army had also 
been raised by Mr Walt Slocombe, CPA Senior Adviser on National Security and 
Defense, in discussion with Mr Hoon. Dissolution was a key decision which was 
to have a significant effect on the alienation of the Sunni community and the 
development of an insurgency in Iraq, and the terms and timing of this important 
Order should have been approved by both Washington and London.


*  Decisions on how to spend the Development Fund for Iraq, which resolution 
1483 gave the CPA the power to make. CPA Regulation No.2 subsequently 
vested Ambassador Bremer with control of the Fund, effectively placing it 
under US control. This exacerbated concerns about the under‑resourcing 
of CPA(South) as expressed in Mr Straw’s letter to Mr Blair of 5 June 2003 
(see Section 10.1). 

*  The creation of the Iraqi Central Bank as an independent body in July 2003 
(see Sections 9.2 and 10.1). This came as a surprise to the UK despite the 
close involvement of officials from the Treasury in arrangements for Iraq’s 
new currency and budget. 

*  The creation of a new Iraqi Central Criminal Court (see Section 9.2), the 
announcement of which UK officials could not delay for long enough to 
enable the Attorney General to give his view on its legality under the terms 
of resolution 1483. 

*  Production of the CPA’s ‘Vision for Iraq’ and ‘Achieving the Vision’ (see 

Sections 9.2 and 10.1). Mr Sawers alerted the FCO to the first document on 
6 July when it was already at an advanced stage of drafting, and by 18 July it 
had been signed off by the Pentagon. No formal UK approval was sought for 
a document which was intended to provide strategic direction to the Coalition’s 
non‑military effort in Iraq. 

676.  UK involvement in CPA decisions about the scope and implementation of 
de‑Ba’athification policy is considered in Section 11.2.

677.  In some areas, the UK was able to affect CPA policy through the influence that 
Mr Sawers or his successor Sir Jeremy Greenstock exerted on senior US officials. Both 
used their diplomatic experience to build connections with Iraqi politicians and contribute 
to the political development of Iraq. Instances of UK influence included:

*  Mr Sawers’ involvement in the plans for an Interim Iraqi Administration, 
in respect of which he considered that “much of the thinking is ours”.236 
*  Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s “two chickens, two eggs” plan, which overcame political 
stalemate between the CPA and Grand Ayatollah al‑Sistani on how the new Iraqi 
Constitution should be created. The plan led to the 15 November Agreement 
which set the timetable for transfer of sovereignty to a transitional administration 
by 30 June 2004. 

*  Ensuring that negotiations on the content of the Transitional Administrative Law 

reached a successful conclusion. Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that 
he had prevented the Kurdish delegation from leaving, “which Bremer wasn’t 
aware of”.237 

236 Telegram 028 IraqRep to FCO London, 1 June 2003, ‘Iraq: Political Process’. 
237 Private hearing, 26 May 2010, page 64. 

*  The level of female representation in Iraq’s new political structures, including the 
25 percent “goal” for members of the National Assembly set by the Transitional 
Administrative Law, which the UK pursued with some success. 

678.  In the absence of decision‑making arrangements in which the UK had a formal 
role, too much reliance was placed on communication between Mr Blair and President 
Bush, one of the very small number of ways of influencing US policy. Some issues were 
addressed by this route: for instance, using his regular conversations with President 
Bush, Mr Blair was able, with some success, to urge caution in relation to the US 
operation in Fallujah in April 2004. 

679.  But the channel of communication between Prime Minister and President 
should be reserved for the most strategic and most intractable issues. It is not 
the right mechanism for day‑to‑day policy‑making or an effective way of making 
tactical decisions. 

680.  It is impossible to say whether a greater and more formal UK input to CPA 
decisions would have led to better outcomes. But it is clear that the UK’s ability to 
influence decisions made by the CPA was not commensurate with its responsibilities 
as joint Occupying Power. 

## A DECLINE IN SECURITY
681.  From early June 2003, and throughout the summer, there were signs that security 
in both Baghdad and the South was deteriorating. The MOD’s SPG warned that “more 
organised opposition to the Coalition may be emerging”238 as discontent about the 
Coalition’s failure to deliver a secure environment began to grow in the Iraqi population. 

682.  The extent of the decline in Baghdad and central Iraq overshadowed the decline 
in Multi‑National Division (South‑East) (MND(SE)). Food shortages and the failure 
of essential services such as the supply of electricity and water, plus lack of progress 
in the political process, however, began to erode the relationship between UK forces 
and the local population. The deterioration was exemplified by attacks on UK forces 
in Majar al‑Kabir in Maysan province on 22 and 24 June. 

683.  As the summer wore on, authoritative sources in the UK, such as the JIC, began 
to identify issues with the potential to escalate into conflict and to recognise the likelihood 
that extremist groups would become more co‑ordinated. The constraint imposed on 
reconstruction activities by the lack of security began to be apparent. Mr Sawers and 
Sir David Manning expressed concern about whether the UK had sufficient troops 
deployed in MND(SE), and about the permeability of Maysan’s substantial border 
with Iran. 

238 Minute SECCOS to PSO/CDS, 10 June 2003, ‘OP COS Paper: UK Contribution to Iraq: Strategic Intent 
and Direction’ attaching Paper SPG, 9 June 2003, ‘UK contribution to Iraq: strategic intent and direction’. 


684.  From early July, security was seen in Whitehall as the key concern and was raised 
by Mr Blair with President Bush. 

685.  A circular analysis began to develop, in which progress on reconstruction required 
security to be improved, and improved security required the consent generated by 
reconstruction activity. Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff 
(Commitments), reported “a decline in Iraqi consent to the Coalition in MND(SE) due to 
the failure by the Coalition to deliver improvements in essential services” and that Shia 
leaders were warning of a short grace period before further significant deterioration. 

686.  By the autumn of 2003, violence was escalating in Baghdad and attacks were 
becoming more sophisticated. Attacks on the UN in August and September, which 
injured and killed a number of UN officials including the UN Special Representative for 
Iraq, prompted some organisations to withdraw their international staff. Although Basra 
was less turbulent than the capital, the risk of a ripple effect from Baghdad – as identified 
by Gen Jackson in May – remained. 

687.  The JIC assessed on 3 September that the security environment would probably 
worsen over the year ahead. There had been a number of serious attacks on the 
Coalition in MND(SE), and Islamic “extremists/terrorists”239 were expected to remain 
a long‑term threat in Iraq. The UK’s military and civilian representatives on the ground 
were reporting a growing insurgency in central Iraq.

688.  Despite that evidence, military planning under the leadership of General 
Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, proceeded on the basis that the situation 
in Basra would remain relatively benign. 

689.  The Inquiry considers that a deterioration in security could and should have been 
identified by Lt Gen Reith by the end of August 2003 and that the cumulative evidence 
of a deteriorating security situation should have led him to conclude that the underlying 
assumptions on which the UK’s Iraq campaign was based was over‑optimistic, and 
to instigate a review of the scale of the UK’s military effort in Iraq.

690.  There were a number of issues that might have been examined by such a review, 
including:

*  whether the UK had sufficient resources in MND(SE) to deal with a worsening 
*  whether the UK should engage outside MND(SE) in the interests of Iraq’s 

security situation; and

overall stability (as had been advocated by Gen Jackson, Maj Gen Richards 
and Lt Gen Pigott).

691.  No such review took place.

239 JIC Assessment, 3 September 2003, ‘Iraq: Threats to Security’. 

692.  There was a strong case for reinforcing MND(SE) so that it could handle its 
high‑priority tasks (providing essential security for reconstruction projects, protecting 
existing infrastructure, guarding key sites and improving border security to inhibit 
the import of arms from Iran) effectively in changing circumstances. Those tasks all 
demanded a higher level of manpower than was available. Although additional military 
personnel were deployed in September 2003, mainly to fill existing gaps in support for 
reconstruction activities, their numbers were far too small to have a significant impact. 

693.  The failure to consider the option of reinforcement at this time was a serious 
omission and Lt Gen Reith and Gen Walker should have ensured that UK force levels in 
MND(SE) were formally reconsidered in autumn 2003 or at the latest by the end of the 
year. Increases in UK force levels in order to address the security situation should have 
been recommended to Ministers. Any opportunity to regain the initiative and pre‑empt 
further deterioration in the security situation was lost.

694.  In October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Lieutenant General Ricardo 
Sanchez, Commander Combined Joint Task Force‑7, had “come to recognise that 
Coalition operations are at a standstill and that there is a need to regain momentum”.240 
Doubts started to build about the chances of credible elections based on a legitimate 
constitution in the course of 2004 and work began to look for alternatives to the plan set 
out by Ambassador Bremer. The “bloodiest 48‑hour period in Baghdad since March”,241 
including an attack on the al‑Rashid Hotel in Baghdad’s Green Zone, was sufficient 
to convince some that a pivotal point in the security situation had been reached. 

695.  When President Bush visited London in November, Mr Blair provided him with a 
paper written by Sir Jeremy Greenstock which argued that security should be the highest 
priority in the run‑up to June 2004, when the Iraqi Transitional Government would take 
power. Sir Jeremy suggested that troop levels should be looked at again and highlighted 
“the dangers we face if we do not get a grip on the security situation” as a topic that 
President Bush and Mr Blair needed to discuss in stark terms. 

696.  The constraints within which the UK was operating as a result of the limited scale 
of forces deployed in Iraq were articulated clearly for the Chiefs of Staff in December. 
Lt Gen Fry argued that a strategy of “early effect”242 was needed which prioritised 
campaign success. Operation TELIC was the UK “Main Effort”, but deploying additional 
resources in a way that was compliant with the Defence Planning Assumptions would 
require the withdrawal of resources from other operations. 

697.  On 1 January 2004, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote bluntly: “This theatre remains 
a security crisis.”243

698.  Despite mounting evidence of violent insurgency, the UK’s policy of military 
drawdown in Iraq continued. After force levels had been reviewed in January, the 
rationale for continued drawdown was based on adjusted criteria by which the success 
of Security Sector Reform would be judged, meaning that such reform would be 
implemented “only to applicable standards for Iraq”.244

## THE TURNING POINT
699.  February 2004 was the worst month for Coalition casualties since the fall of 
Saddam Hussein’s regime. More than 200 people, mainly Iraqi citizens, were killed in 
suicide attacks. Attacks on the Iraqi Security Forces were increasing and concerns about 
Islamic extremists operating in Iraq began to grow. By the end of March, more than 
200 attacks targeting Iraqi citizens were being reported each week. 

700.  In April, there was a sudden escalation in attacks by the Jaysh al‑Mahdi (JAM) in 
Basra, described by the General Officer Commanding MND(SE) as “like a switch had 
been flicked”.245 In Fallujah, a US offensive which followed the ambush and murder of 
four security contractors provoked an angry response from the Sunni community. 

701.  The significant worsening of security, coupled with revelations of abuse by members 
of the US military of Iraqi detainees held in Abu Ghraib prison, led many of the Inquiry’s 
witnesses to conclude that the spring of 2004 had been a turning point. 

702.  At the end of April, Mr Blair’s analysis was that the key issue in Iraq was not 
multi‑faceted, rather it was “simple: security”.246 

703.  Despite the failing security situation in MND(SE) in spring 2004, Gen Walker 
was explicit that no additional troops were required for the tasks currently assigned 
to the UK. 

704.  The Chiefs of Staff maintained the view they had originally reached in November 
2003, that HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) should not be actively considered 
for deployment to Iraq, even though:

*  Iraq was a higher priority for the UK than Afghanistan; 
*  security in Iraq was clearly worsening and had been identified by Mr Blair 
*  there had been a specific US request for deployment of HQ ARRC.

# Transition

## UK INFLUENCE ON US STRATEGY POST‑CPA
705.  In June 2004, the US and UK ceased to be Occupying Powers in Iraq and the 
CPA was disbanded. Responsibility for day‑to‑day interaction on civil affairs with the 
Iraqi Interim Government on civil affairs passed to the newly appointed British and 
US Ambassadors.

706.  After the handover, the UK’s priorities were to maintain the momentum of the 
political process towards elections in January 2005, and to ensure that the conditions 
for the drawdown of its forces were achieved. 

707.  Mr Blair and President Bush continued to discuss Iraq on a regular basis. 
It continued to be the case that relatively small issues were raised to this level. 
The UK took false comfort that it was involved in US decision‑making from the strength 
of that relationship. 

708.  Themes which Mr Blair emphasised to President Bush included the acceleration 
of Security Sector Reform and the Iraqiisation of security, UN engagement, better 
outreach to the Sunni community (often referred to as “reconciliation”), provision of direct 
support to Prime Minister Ayad Allawi and better use of local media to transmit a positive 
message about the coalition’s intentions and actions. 

## PLANNING FOR WITHDRAWAL
709.  By July 2004, the UK envisaged that, providing the necessary criteria were 
met, there would be a gradual reduction in troop numbers during 2005 leading 
to final withdrawal in 2006, to be followed by a period of “Strategic Overwatch”.

710.  The most important of the criteria that would enable coalition troops to withdraw 
was the ability of the Iraqi Security Forces to take the lead on security (Iraqiisation). 
Having recognised that a stable and secure environment was the key factor on which 
progress in Iraq depended, by May 2004 the UK solution was “a better and quicker 
plan for building Iraqi capacity in the Police, Civil Defence Corps, the Army and the 
Intelligence Service”.247 This made sense in the long term but was unlikely to meet 
the requirement to regain control of Iraq rapidly in the face of a mounting insurgency. 
Reform of the Iraqi Security Forces is addressed in detail in Section 12. 

711.  By mid‑August, the level of attacks against coalition forces had matched the 
previous peak in April of the same year. In September, Lieutenant General John McColl 
(Senior British Military Representative – Iraq) judged that the Iraqi Security Forces would 
not be able to take full responsibility for security before 2006.

247 Letter Bowen to Baker, 13 May 2004, ‘Iraq: Security’. 


712.  In September 2004, Gen Walker received a well‑argued piece of advice from 
Lt Gen McColl which made clear that the conditions on which decisions on drawdown 
were to be based were unlikely to be met in the near future. Despite the warnings in 
Lt Gen McColl’s paper and his advice that “the time is right for the consideration of the 
substantive issues”,248 the Chiefs of Staff, chaired by Gen Walker, declined to engage 
in a substantive review of UK options. 

713.  The Inquiry recognises that the scale of the resources which the UK might have 
deployed to deal with the issues was substantially less than the US could bring to bear. 
It is possible that the UK may not have been able to make a real difference, when the 
key strategic change that might have affected the outcome was the deployment of a 
much larger force. But proper consideration ought to have been given to what options 
were available, including for the deployment of additional personnel. Mr Straw raised 
the need for such a debate with Mr Blair in October. 

714.  The UK had consistently resisted US requests to deploy additional personnel, 
which Lt Gen McColl described as having “chipped away at the US/UK relationship”,249 
but in October it was agreed that the Black Watch would be deployed to North Babil 
for 30 days to backfill US forces needed for operations in Fallujah. Approximately 
350 personnel from 1st Battalion, the Royal Highland Fusiliers were also deployed to 
Iraq to provide additional security across MND(SE) during the election period in January 
and February 2005. The UK remained reluctant to commit any further forces in the longer 
term: when Dutch forces withdrew from Muthanna province, the UK instead redeployed 
forces from elsewhere in MND(SE) plus a small amount of additional logistic support. 

715.  In January 2005, Lt Gen Fry produced a thoughtful and realistic assessment of the 
prospects for security in Iraq, observing that “we are not on track to deliver the Steady 
State Criteria (SSC) before the UN mandate expires, or even shortly thereafter”.250 He 
judged that “only additional military effort by the MNF‑I [Multi‑National Force – Iraq] as 
a whole” might be able to get the campaign back on track. Lt Gen Fry identified three 
possible courses of action for the UK: increasing the UK scale of effort, maintaining the 
status quo or, if it were judged that the campaign was irretrievable, accepting failure and 
seeking to mitigate UK liability.

716.  The Inquiry endorses Lt Gen Fry’s assessment of the options open to the UK 
at this point and considers that full and proper consideration should have been given 
to each option by DOP. 

717.  In his advice to Mr Blair on 21 January, Gen Walker did not expose the 
assessment made by Lt Gen Fry that only additional military effort by the MNF‑I might 
be able to get the campaign back on track.

250 Minute DCDS(C) to APS 2/SofS [MOD], 11 January 2005, ‘Iraq 2005 – a UK MOD perspective’.

718.  On 30 January, elections for the Transitional National Assembly and Provincial 
Assemblies took place across Iraq. Security arrangements involved 130,000 personnel 
from the Iraqi Security Forces, supported by 184,500 troops from the MNF‑I. The JIC 
assessed that perhaps fewer than 10 percent of voters had turned out in the Sunni 
heartlands and judged that “without Sunni engagement in the political process, it will not 
be possible significantly to undermine the insurgency”.

719.  In April, the JIC assessed that:

“A significant Sunni insurgency will continue through 2005 and beyond, but the 
opportunities for reducing it appear greater than we judged in early February.”251

## THE IMPACT OF AFGHANISTAN
720.  In June 2004, the UK had made a public commitment to deploy HQ ARRC to 
Afghanistan in 2006, based on a recommendation from the Chiefs of Staff and Mr Hoon, 
and with Mr Straw’s support. HQ ARRC was a NATO asset for which the UK was the 
lead nation and provided 60 percent of its staff. 

721.  It appears that senior members of the Armed Forces reached the view, throughout 
2004 and 2005, that little more would be achieved in MND(SE) and that it would 
make more sense to concentrate military effort on Afghanistan where it might have 
greater effect. 

722.  In February 2005, the UK announced that it would switch its existing military effort 
in Afghanistan from the north to Helmand province in the south. 

723.  In 2002, A New Chapter, an MOD review of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review 
(SDR), had reaffirmed that the UK’s Armed Forces would be unable to support two 
enduring medium scale military operations at the same time:

“Since the SDR we have assumed that we should plan to be able to undertake either 
a single major operation (of a similar scale and duration to our contribution to the 
Gulf War in 1990‑91), or undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a 
lesser scale (as in the mid‑1990s in Bosnia), while retaining the ability to mount a 
second substantial deployment ... if this were made necessary by a second crisis. 
We would not, however, expect both deployments to involve war‑fighting or to 
maintain them simultaneously for longer than six months.”252

724.  As described in Section 16.1, since 2002 the Armed Forces had been consistently 
operating at or above the level of concurrency defined in the 1998 SDR, and the 
continuation of Op TELIC had placed additional strain on military personnel. 

251 JIC Assessment, 6 April 2005, ‘Iraq: The State of the Insurgency’. 
252 Ministry of Defence, Strategic Defence Review: A New Chapter, July 2002, page 14.


725.  By May 2005, the UK had been supporting an operation of at least medium scale 
in Iraq for more than two years. The Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas 
Policy Sub‑Committee on Iraq (DOP(I)) recognised that future force levels in Iraq would 
need to be considered in the context of the requirement to achieve “strategic balance” 
with commitments in Afghanistan, to ensure that both were properly resourced. 

726.  In July 2005, DOP agreed proposals for both the transfer of the four provinces 
in MND(SE) to Iraqi control and for the deployment of the UK Provincial Reconstruction 
Team then based in northern Afghanistan to Helmand province in the South, along with 
an infantry battlegroup and full helicopter support – around 2,500 personnel. 

727.  As described under the heading ‘Iraqiisation’ below, the proposals to transfer 
responsibility for security in the four provinces of MND(SE) to Iraqi control were based 
on high‑risk assumptions about the capability of the Iraqi Security Forces to take the 
lead for security. If those assumptions proved to be inaccurate and the UK was unable to 
withdraw, agreement to the Helmand deployment in Afghanistan effectively constrained 
the UK’s ability to respond by increasing troop levels in Iraq.

728.  In January 2006, Cabinet approved the decision to deploy to Helmand. Dr Reid, 
the Defence Secretary, announced that the UK was “preparing for a deployment to 
southern Afghanistan” which included a Provincial Reconstruction Team as “part of 
a larger, more than 3,300‑strong British force providing the security framework”.253 

729.  The impact of that decision was summarised neatly by Gen Walker as:

“Militarily, the UK force structure is already stretched and, with two concurrent 
medium scale operations in prospect, will soon become exceptionally so in 
niche areas.”254 

730.  Niche capabilities such as helicopter support and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target 
Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) were essential to the successful conduct 
of operations. 

731.  From July 2005 onwards, decisions in relation to resources for Iraq were 
effectively made under the influence of the demands of the UK effort in Afghanistan. 
Although Iraq remained the stated UK main effort, the Government no longer had the 
option of a substantial reinforcement of its forces there, should it have considered one 
necessary. When the US announced in January 2007 that it would send a surge of 
resources to Iraq, the UK was consequently unable to contemplate a parallel surge 
of its own.

732.  The impact of the decision to deploy to Helmand on the availability of key 
equipment capabilities for Iraq, and on the level of stretch felt by military personnel, 
is addressed in Sections 14 and 16.

## IRAQIISATION
733.  After becoming Defence Secretary in May 2005, Dr Reid had continued the policy 
of reducing UK troop levels based on the transition of lead responsibility for security 
to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). In one of his early acts as Defence Secretary, he 
announced the deployment of just over 400 additional personnel to enhance the UK’s 
effort in training the ISF, which would “enable them to take on ever greater responsibility 
for their own security and so pave the way for UK troops to withdraw”.255

734.  The proposals for transfer of the four provinces in MND(SE) to Iraqi control agreed 
in July 2005 suggested transition from MNF‑I to ISF primacy in Basra from March 2006, 
based on the assumption that the ISF would, by that point, be capable of taking on 
responsibility for security in what was likely to remain a very challenging environment.

735.  There was sufficient reliable contemporary evidence available, including from the 
JIC and in reports from commanders in theatre, to demonstrate that the assumption that 
the ISF would be ready to take the lead in Basra by that point was probably unrealistic.

736.  In September 2005, Mr Blair expressed his concerns about ISF capability, 
following reports of police involvement in attacks on the MNF in Basra. But despite 
concerns that had been expressed about the capacity of the ISF, Dr Reid recommended 
that a reduction in UK forces should take place in October or November 2005. 

737.  A few days after Dr Reid made his recommendation, the Jameat incident in Basra 
(see Section 12.1) raised questions about the ISF in MND(SE). Officials from the FCO, 
the MOD and DFID judged that the incident had highlighted the risks to achieving UK 
objectives in MND(SE), and that those risks had implications for military resources. 
Nevertheless, assumptions about ISF readiness were not re‑examined by Ministers. 
The incident should have prompted a more searching analysis of whether the conditions 
necessary for drawdown were likely to be met within the planned timetable. Reluctance 
to consider the potential implications of the Jameat incident obscured what it had 
revealed about the security situation in MND(SE).

738.  The critical importance of ISF capability in assessing readiness for transfer to 
Provincial Iraqi Control, on which UK plans to draw down were based, was emphasised 
by the ‘Conditions for Provincial Transfer’ published by the Joint Iraqi/MNF Committee 
to Transfer Security Responsibility, and by Dr Reid, who told DOP(I) that “successful 
Iraqiisation remains the key”.256 DOP(I) decided that Dr Reid should have lead 
responsibility for building the capacity of the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) in Basra in 
addition to his responsibility for the Iraqi Army.

739.  In October 2005, Mr Blair asked for a major and sustained push to make progress 
on the ability of the ISF to take the lead on security. Gen Jackson raised concerns about 
ISF effectiveness in a minute to Gen Walker, and concluded: “it is not to our credit that 

255 House of Commons, Official Report, 25 May 2005, column 15WS.
256 Paper Reid, 11 October 2005, ‘Iraq: Security Update’.


we have known about the inadequacies of the IPS for so long and yet failed to address 
them”.257 The Assessments Staff reinforced the lack of progress in reforming the ISF. 

740.  In October 2005, the Chiefs of Staff made a stark assessment of the insurgency 
and coalition strategy in Iraq. They concluded that “Ministers needed to be clear 
that the campaign could potentially be heading for ‘strategic failure’, with grave 
national and international consequences if the appropriate actions were not taken”.258 
Gen Walker judged that only 5 percent of UK military effort in MND(SE) was devoted 
to counter‑insurgency operations. But neither Air Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy, Commander 
Joint Operations, nor Gen Walker reassessed UK force requirements in Iraq, based 
on those two assessments. 

741.  The security situation at this point should have resulted in a reassessment of the 
UK troop levels needed to achieve the UK’s key outcomes in MND(SE). Although the 
responsibility for tactical decision‑making rested with commanders on the ground, it was 
for Gen Walker to ensure that those commanders had sufficient resources to deliver. 

742.  The absence of additional resources placed further pressure on the UK’s ability 
to deliver the conditions required for transfer. At the end of 2005 and in early 2006 
there were further indications that the ISF were not ready to operate alone. The MOD 
reported to the final DOP(I) meeting of 2005 that the capacity of the Iraqi administration 
and security forces to assume responsibility, acknowledging the challenge of increasing 
sectarianism and militia infiltration, was one of the key challenges remaining. 

743.  In March 2006, the JIC again highlighted doubts about the ability of the Iraqi Army 
to operate without MNF support and concerns about the corruption and infiltration of 
the IPS. 

744.  US concerns about UK plans for the transition of Maysan and Muthanna to Iraqi 
control in May were such that Dr Reid adapted them to include a small residual team 
providing mentoring and support to the Iraqi Army. 

745.  Dr Reid continued to press ahead with drawdown and announced that troop 
levels would reduce in May 2006 from approximately 8,000 to around 7,200 based on 
“completion of various security sector reform tasks, a reduction in the support levels for 
those tasks, and recent efficiency measures in theatre”.259 That rationale did not include 
an assessment of the effect of those tasks on the capability of the ISF.

# Preparation for withdrawal

## A MAJOR DIVERGENCE IN STRATEGY
746.  US and UK strategies for Iraq had in effect been on different courses since the UK 
decision to focus its attention on MND(SE) in 2003. As a result of that decision, the UK 
had acquired distinctly different priorities from the US. It was only marginally involved in 
the central tasks of stabilising the Iraqi Government in Baghdad and managing sectarian 
divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation 
calm while building the case for drawdown. 

747.  For some time, there had been indications of tension between the US and 
UK regarding assessments of progress, and differing assumptions about whether 
plans were needed for long‑term bases in Iraq. In May 2006, Mr Blair was told about 
“rumblings from the US system about UK failure to grip the security situation in what they 
regard as a strategically vital part of Iraq”.260 Gen Jackson felt compelled to report that:

“The perception, right or wrong, in some – if not all – US military circles is that the 
UK is motivated more by the short‑term political gain of early withdrawal than by the 
long‑term importance of mission accomplishment; and that, as a result, MND(SE)’s 
operational posture is too laissez faire and lacks initiative ...”261

748.  In January 2007, the divergence between US and UK strategies was thrown into 
sharp relief by President Bush’s announcement that the US would adopt a new strategy, 
of which a prominent feature would be the deployment of a surge of US forces, primarily 
to Baghdad and its environs. UK assessments of the prospects for the new US policy 
were bleak, reflecting widespread pessimism about the prospects for Iraq. UK strategy 
continued to look towards withdrawal. 

749.  US concerns about the differences in approach were evident. In February 2007, 
Sir David Manning, British Ambassador to the US, reported that Secretary Rice had 
asked him “to tell her honestly whether the UK was now making for the exit as fast 
as possible”.262 

750.  The divergence in strategies was also illustrated by the conditions‑based process 
through which the four provinces in MND(SE) were transferred to Provincial Iraqi Control 
(PIC) during 2007. Although each transfer was signed off by senior members of the US 
military, there was persistent reporting of US concerns about readiness for PIC, whether 
the conditions had actually been met and the wider impact of transfer. 

751.  The US was also uncomfortable about arrangements made by the UK with a militia 
group in Basra which allowed the safe exit of UK troops from their main base in the city.

31 January 2007’. 


## A POSSIBLE CIVIL WAR
752.  By March 2006, senior members of the UK military were considering the possibility 
of civil war in Iraq, prompted by rising levels of sectarian violence and concerns that the 
Iraqi Government was “not ... perceived as even‑handed in security issues”.263 The risk 
of civil war had been acknowledged by Prime Minister Ibrahim Ja’afari in the wake of the 
bombing of the al‑Askari mosque in February. Although there was general agreement 
that the situation in Iraq did not constitute civil war, the risk that one might develop was 
considered to be real. 

753.  At this time, the presence in Iraq of the MNF was authorised by resolution 1637 
(2005). The exchange of letters between Prime Minister Ja’afari and the President of the 
Security Council which accompanied the resolution clearly identified providing security 
for the Iraqi people as the reason why a continued MNF presence was necessary. 

754.  In late April, FCO officials were concerned that security in Basra was declining 
and that a determined and sustained effort, including a more assertive military posture, 
would be required to deliver the UK’s objective of transferring Basra to Iraqi control by 
late 2006 or early 2007.

755.  Accounts from mid‑2006 suggested that security in MND(SE) was a significant 
concern, characterised by “steady, if generally unspectacular, decline”264 and increased 
militia activity. The UK military’s approach had generated US concern and the security 
situation was limiting UK civilian activity. 

756.  Gen Jackson’s assessment in May of the short‑term security prospects in Iraq 
was bleak. He judged that “what we will leave behind will not look much like strategic 
success. Ten years hence our strategy may fully bear fruit.”265

757.  After visiting Iraq in early May, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the 
Defence Staff, advised Dr Reid that there should be no change to the operational 
approach and that there were “compelling reasons” why the UK should “press on” 
with handing over security to Iraq, including to permit the UK’s continuing build‑up in 
Afghanistan.266 ACM Stirrup identified the risk that UK withdrawal from Basra would be 
seen as a “strategic failure” and suggested that “astute conditioning of the UK public 
may be necessary” to avoid that.

758.  ACM Stirrup’s view that the UK should press ahead with drawdown despite the 
security challenges in Basra was not consistent with Government policy that withdrawal 
should be conditions‑based.

266 Minute Stirrup to SofS [MOD], 8 May 2006, ‘CDS Visit to Iraq and Afghanistan – 5‑7 May 06’. 

759.  ACM Stirrup’s acceptance that the “law of diminishing returns” was “now firmly 
in play” and that there was “an increasing risk” that UK forces would “become part of 
the problem, rather than the solution” had some validity: it was clear from accounts 
of the situation in Basra that UK forces were not preventing a steady decline in 
security. ACM Stirrup was also right to advise Dr Reid that the MNF in Iraq faced a 
“multifaceted”, sophisticated and dangerous enemy; that serious issues remained 
in Basra (militia activity, poor governance, insecurity); and that it was possible the 
UK would be accused of strategic failure. 

760.  The established policy was that UK forces would withdraw as the capabilities of 
the ISF increased until responsibility could be handed over to the Iraqi Government. 
ACM Stirrup’s proposed remedy of continued drawdown and managing public opinion 
did not mitigate the risk of strategic failure he described.

761.  In the summer of 2006, in recognition of the need to stabilise Basra and prepare 
it for transition to Iraqi control, the UK developed the Basra Security Plan, “a plan to 
improve Basra through operations, high impact reconstruction and SSR [Security Sector 
Reform] ... lasting for up to six months”.267 The military element of the plan became 
known as Operation SALAMANCA and included operations against militia groups. 

762.  In August 2006, ACM Stirrup was asked to give direction on both seeking US help 
for Op SALAMANCA and the possibility of deploying UK forces to support US operations 
outside MND(SE).

763.  While ACM Stirrup stressed the importance of senior Iraqi political support 
if Op SALAMANCA was to be a success, Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, 
the Senior British Military Representative – Iraq, indicated a concern that even with 
US support the capabilities available in MND(SE) might not be sufficient successfully 
to deliver Op SALAMANCA. 

764.  ACM Stirrup directed that it was acceptable for the UK to make use of US 
enablers, such as aviation, in MND(SE), but that, in general, commitments in MND(SE) 
were to be met by existing MND(SE) personnel (including contractors) and any shortfalls 
were to be identified and considered appropriately. 

765.  ACM Stirrup also directed that the deployment of UK troops to Multi‑National 
Division (Centre South): 

“... crossed a clear policy ‘red line’ and seemed counter‑intuitive, given that 
consideration was also being given to obtaining US forces for MND(SE). The UK 
needed to draw down its force levels as soon as practicable, both in MND(SE) 
and elsewhere.”268

268 Minutes, 2 August 2006, Chiefs of Staff meeting. 


766.  The decision not to allow the use of US support in Basra was an important one. 
The Inquiry considers that the question of what was needed to make Op SALAMANCA 
a success should have been addressed directly by ACM Stirrup, whose response 
instead precluded proper consideration of whether additional UK resources would be 
required. 

767.  There was continuing resistance to any suggestion that UK forces should 
operate outside MND(SE) and there may have been concern that US participation in 
Op SALAMANCA would have led to an obligation on the UK to engage more outside 
MND(SE). This might not, as ACM Stirrup observed, be consistent with a commitment 
to drawdown, but might have reduced the risk of strategic failure. 

768.  The nature of Op SALAMANCA was constrained by the Iraqi Government in 
September 2006, so that the eventual operation (renamed Operation SINBAD) left 
“Basra in the hands of the militant militia and death squads, with the ISF unable to 
impose, let alone maintain, the rule of law”.269 This contributed to the conditions which 
led the UK into negotiations with JAM in early 2007. 

769.  Attempts were subsequently made to present Op SINBAD as equivalent to the 
2007 US surge. Although there was some resemblance between the “Clear, Hold, Build” 
tactics to be used by US surge forces and the UK’s tactics for Op SINBAD, the UK 
operation did not deploy sufficient additional resources to conduct “Hold” and “Build” 
phases with anything like the same strategic effect. The additional 360 troops deployed 
by the UK could not have had the same effect as the more than 20,000 troops surged 
into Baghdad and its environs by the US. 

770.  At the end of 2006, tensions between the military and civilian teams in MND(SE) 
became explicit. In a report to Mr Blair, Major General Richard Shirreff, General 
Officer Commanding MND(SE), diagnosed that the existing arrangement, in which the 
Provincial Reconstruction Team was located in Kuwait, “lacks unity of command and 
unity of purpose”270 and proposed the establishment of a “Joint Inter‑Agency Task Force” 
in Basra led by the General Officer Commanding MND(SE). 

771.  ACM Stirrup’s advice to Mr Blair was that it was “too late” to implement 
Maj Gen Shirreff’s proposal. That may have been the right conclusion, but the 
effect was to deter consideration of a real problem and of ways in which military and 
civilian operations in MND(SE) could be better aligned.

772.  The adequacy of UK force levels in Iraq and the effectiveness of the UK’s efforts in 
MND(SE) were explicitly questioned in Maj Gen Shirreff’s end of tour report.

## FORCE LEVEL REVIEW
773.  The balance of forces between Iraq and Afghanistan was reviewed by DOP in 
February 2007 on the basis that the UK could only sustain the enduring operational 
deployment of eight battlegroups.

774.  ACM Stirrup’s “strong advice”,271 with which DOP agreed, was that the UK should 
provide two additional battlegroups to the International Security Assistance Force in 
Afghanistan, reducing the Iraq to Afghanistan battlegroup ratio from 6:2 to 5:3 and 
then 4:4. 

775.  This advice did not include an assessment of either the actual state of security 
in Basra or the impact on the UK’s ability to deliver its objectives (including that 
drawdown should be conditions‑based) and responsibilities under resolution 1723 (2006). 
The advice did identify US “nervousness” about the UK proposals. 

776.  In early May, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, sought ACM 
Stirrup’s advice on the future of the UK military presence in Iraq. ACM Stirrup advised 
that the UK should press ahead with drawdown from Iraq on the basis that there was 
little more the UK could achieve. There was “no militarily useful mission”.272 

777.  Mr Blair was concerned about the implications of ACM Stirrup’s position unless 
the political circumstances in Basra changed first. He commented: “it will be very hard 
to present as anything other than a total withdrawal ... it cd be very dangerous for the 
stability of Iraq, & the US will, rightly, be v. concerned.”273

778.  After visiting Basra again in mid‑May, ACM Stirrup continued to recommend the 
drawdown of UK forces. But other contemporary evidence indicated a more negative 
picture of circumstances in Basra than ACM Stirrup’s view that:

“... the Iraqis are increasingly in a position to take on responsibility for their own 
problems and therefore they might wish to look to propose the south of the country 
as a model through which we can recommend a drawdown of forces.”274

779.  In July 2007, FCO and MOD officials recognised that leaving Basra Palace would 
mean moving to PIC in fact if not in name. Mr Brown, who had become Prime Minister 
in June, was keen that the gap between leaving the Palace and transfer to PIC should 
be as small as possible, since UK situational awareness and ability to conduct operations 
in Basra would be limited once the Palace was no longer in use. 

780.  During a visit to Iraq at the start of July, ACM Stirrup sought to convince 
senior US officers that Basra was ready for transfer to PIC on the basis that it would 
not be possible to demonstrate readiness until after the transfer had taken place.

General David Petraeus, Commanding General MNF‑I, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, 
US Ambassador to Iraq, remained “circumspect” on the timing of PIC.275 They considered 
that there remained “significant problems” associated with “unstable politics” and “JAM 
infiltration” in Basra. 

781.  As they reached the end of their respective tours of duty, both Major General 
Jonathan Shaw, General Officer Commanding MND(SE) from January to August 2007, 
and Lieutenant General William Rollo, Senior British Military Representative – Iraq 
from July 2007 to March 2008, identified the impact of limited resources on the UK’s 
military effort and questioned the drive for continued drawdown in Iraq in order to 
prioritise resources for Helmand. Maj Gen Shaw wrote: “We have been hamstrung for 
resources throughout the tour, driven by the rising strategic significance of the Afghan 
deployment.”276 

782.  During a visit to Iraq in October 2007, ACM Stirrup was briefed by Major General 
Graham Binns, General Office Commanding MND(SE) from August 2007 to February 
2008, that the ISF might have only limited ability to cope in the event that JAM resumed 
combat operations. The JIC and others also identified continued weaknesses in the 
ISF. Their “ability and willingness to maintain security in the South remains patchy and 
dependent on MNF training, logistic and specialist air support”.277 

## THE BEGINNING OF THE END
783.  On 27 February 2008, the JIC assessed security prospects in the South at the 
request of the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ): security in Basra remained 
a concern.

784.  In March 2008, Prime Minister Maliki instigated the Charge of the Knights to 
tackle militia groups in Basra. That such an important operation came as a surprise 
was an indication of the distance between the UK and Iraqi Governments at this point. 

785.  When the Charge of the Knights began, the UK found itself to be both 
compromised in the eyes of the Iraqi Government and unable to offer significant 
operational support, as a result of the tactical decision to negotiate with JAM1 and the 
absence of situational awareness in Basra after withdrawing from the Basra Palace site. 

786.  On 1 April, ACM Stirrup briefed the Overseas and Defence Sub‑Committee of the 
National Security, International Relations and Development Committee (NSID(OD)) that 
the UK military task would be complete by the end of 2008; its timetable would not be 
affected by the Charge of the Knights.

276 Letter Shaw to Houghton, 14 August 2007, ‘Post operation report Shawforce Jan‑Aug 07’.
277 JIC Assessment, 27 February 2008, ‘Iraq: Security Prospects in the South’. 

787.  ACM Stirrup’s conclusion that there was no need to review UK drawdown plans 
was premature in the light of both the level of uncertainty generated by the Charge of 
the Knights and continued questions about the ability of the ISF to take the security 
lead in Basra. 

# Did the UK achieve its objectives in Iraq?
788.  From mid‑2005 onwards, various senior individuals – officials, military officers and 
Ministers – began to consider whether the UK was heading towards “strategic failure” 
in Iraq. 

789.  The term “strategic failure” was variously used to mean:

*  the development of a widespread sectarian conflict or civil war in Iraq;
*  “victory” for terrorist groups; 
*  collapse of the democratic process; 
*  failure to achieve the UK’s objectives; 
*  failure to achieve a stable and secure environment in Basra;
*  the collapse of the UK/Iraq relationship;
*  the division of Iraq and the end of its existence as a nation state;
*  damage to the UK’s military and political reputation; and
*  damage to the relationship between the US and UK.

790.  None of the contemporary accounts that the Inquiry has considered reached the 
conclusion that strategic failure was inevitable, although most recognised that without 
some form of corrective action it was a serious risk. 

791.  Although the UK revisited its Iraq strategy with considerable frequency, no 
substantial change in approach was ever implemented: UK troop numbers continued 
to reduce; the size of the civilian deployment varied very little; the Iraqiisation of security 
and handover of responsibility to the Iraqi Government remained key objectives. 

792.  The Iraq of 2009 certainly did not meet the UK’s objectives as described in 
January 2003: it fell far short of strategic success. Although the borders of Iraq were the 
same as they had been in 2003, deep sectarian divisions threatened both stability and 
unity. Those divisions were not created by the coalition, but they were exacerbated by 
its decisions on de‑Ba’athification and on demobilisation of the Iraqi Army and were not 
addressed by an effective programme of reconciliation. 

793.  In January 2009, the JIC judged “internal political failures that could lead to 
renewed violence within and between Iraq’s Sunni, Shia and Kurdish communities”278 
to be the greatest strategic threat to Iraq’s stability. 

278 JIC Assessment, 28 January 2009, ‘Iraq: Threats to Stability and UK Mission Change in 2009’.


794.  The fragility of the situation in Basra, which had been the focus of UK effort in 
MND(SE), was clear. The JIC assessed that threats remained from Iranian‑backed 
JAM Special Groups, and the Iraqi Security Forces remained reliant on support from 
Multi‑National Forces to address weaknesses in leadership and tactical support. Even 
as UK troops withdrew from Basra, the US was sufficiently concerned to deploy its own 
forces there, to secure the border and protect supply lines. 

795.  In 2009, Iraq did have a democratically elected Parliament, in which many of 
Iraq’s communities were represented. But, as demonstrated by the protracted process 
of negotiating agreements on the status of US and then UK forces in Iraq, and the 
continued absence of a much‑needed Hydrocarbons Law, representation did not 
translate into effective government. In 2008, Transparency International judged Iraq to 
be the third most corrupt country in the world, and in mid‑2009 the Assessments Staff 
judged that Government ministries were “riddled with” corruption.279

796.  By 2009, it had been demonstrated that some elements of the UK’s 2003 
objectives for Iraq were misjudged. No evidence had been identified that Iraq possessed 
weapons of mass destruction, with which it might threaten its neighbours and the 
international community more widely. But in the years between 2003 and 2009, events 
in Iraq had undermined regional stability, including by allowing Al Qaida space in which 
to operate and unsecured borders across which its members might move. 

797.  The gap between the ambitious objectives with which the UK entered Iraq and 
the resources that the Government was prepared to commit to the task was substantial 
from the start. Even with more resources it would have been difficult to achieve those 
objectives, as a result of the circumstances of the invasion, the lack of international 
support, the inadequacy of planning and preparation, and the inability to deliver law and 
order. The lack of security hampered progress at every turn. It is therefore not surprising 
that, despite the considerable efforts made by UK civilian and military personnel over 
this period, the results were meagre. 

798.  The Inquiry has not been able to identify alternative approaches that would have 
guaranteed greater success in the circumstances of March 2003. What can be said is 
that a number of opportunities for the sort of candid reappraisal of policies that would 
have better aligned objectives and resources did not take place. There was no serious 
consideration of more radical options, such as an early withdrawal or else a substantial 
increase in effort. The Inquiry has identified a number of moments, especially during the 
first year of the Occupation, when it would have been possible to conduct a substantial 
reappraisal. None took place.

# Key findings

## Development of UK strategy and options, 9/11 to early January 2002
799.  The following key findings are from Section 3.1:

*  After the attacks on the US on 9/11, Mr Blair declared that the UK would 

stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US to defeat and eradicate international 
terrorism. 

*  Mr Blair took an active and leading role throughout the autumn of 2001 in 
building a coalition to act against that threat, including taking military action 
against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.

*  Mr Blair also emphasised the potential risk of terrorists acquiring and using 
*  In relation to Iraq, Mr Blair sought to influence US policy and prevent precipitate 

a nuclear, biological or chemical weapon, and the dangers of inaction.

military action by the US, which he considered would undermine the success 
of the coalition which had been established for action against international 
terrorism. He recommended identifying an alternative policy which would 
command widespread international support. 

*  In December 2001, Mr Blair suggested a strategy for regime change in Iraq 

that would build over time, including “if necessary” taking military action without 
losing international support.

*  The tactics chosen by Mr Blair were to emphasise the threat which Iraq might 
pose, rather than a more balanced consideration of both Iraq’s capabilities and 
intent; and to offer the UK’s support for President Bush in an effort to influence 
his decisions on how to proceed.

*  That remained Mr Blair’s approach in the months that followed.

## Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – 
“axis of evil” to Crawford
800.  The following key findings are from Section 3.2:

*  The UK continued to pursue implementation of the “smarter” economic sanctions 
regime in the first months of 2002, but continuing divisions between Permanent 
Members of the Security Council meant there was no agreement on the way 
forward.

*  In public statements at the end of February and in the first week of March 2002, 

Mr Blair and Mr Straw set out the view that Iraq was a threat which had to be 
dealt with. 

*  At Cabinet on 7 March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw emphasised that no decisions 
had been taken and Cabinet was not being asked to take decisions. Cabinet 
endorsed the conclusion that Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) 


programmes posed a threat to peace and endorsed a strategy of engaging 
closely with the US Government in order to shape policy and its presentation. 
*  At Crawford, Mr Blair offered President Bush a partnership in dealing urgently 
with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. He proposed that the UK and US 
should pursue a strategy based on an ultimatum calling on Iraq to permit the 
return of weapons inspectors or face the consequences. 

*  Following his meeting with President Bush, Mr Blair stated that Saddam Hussein 
*  The acceptance of the possibility that the UK might participate in a military 

had to be confronted and brought back into compliance with the UN.

invasion of Iraq was a profound change in UK thinking. Although no decisions had 
been taken, that became the basis for contingency planning in the months ahead.

## Development of UK strategy and options, April to July 2002
801.  The following key findings are from Section 3.3:

*  By July 2002, the UK Government had concluded that President Bush 
was impatient to move on Iraq and that the US might take military action 
in circumstances that would be difficult for the UK. 

*  Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush of 28 July sought to persuade President Bush 
to use the UN to build a coalition for action by seeking a partnership with the US 
and setting out a framework for action.

*  Mr Blair told President Bush that the UN was the simplest way to encapsulate a 
“casus belli” in some defining way, with an ultimatum to Iraq once military forces 
started to build up in October. That might be backed by a UN resolution.

*  Mr Blair’s Note, which had not been discussed or agreed with his colleagues, 
set the UK on a path leading to diplomatic activity in the UN and the possibility 
of participation in military action in a way that would make it very difficult for the 
UK subsequently to withdraw its support for the US.

## Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 
2002
802.  The following key findings are from Section 3.4:

*  In discussions with the US over the summer of 2002, Mr Blair and Mr Straw 

sought to persuade the US Administration to secure multilateral support before 
taking action on Iraq; and to do so through the UN. They proposed a strategy 
in which the first objective was to offer Iraq the opportunity and last chance to 
comply with its obligations to disarm. 

*  If Iraq did not take that opportunity and military action was required, the UK was 
seeking to establish conditions whereby such action would command multilateral 
support and be taken with the authority of the Security Council.

on 12 September, to take the issue of Iraq back to the UN.

to deal with Iraq; and to recall Parliament to debate the issue. 

*  Mr Blair also decided to publish an explanation of why action was needed 
*  The UK made a significant contribution to President Bush’s decision, announced 
*  Statements made by China, France and Russia after President Bush’s speech 
highlighted the different positions of the five Permanent Members of the Security 
Council, in particular about the role of the Council in deciding whether military 
action was justified. As a result, the negotiation of resolution 1441 was complex 
and difficult. 

## Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 
2002 – the negotiation of resolution 1441
803.  The following key findings are from Section 3.5:

*  The declared objective of the US and UK was to obtain international support 
within the framework of the UN for a strategy of coercive diplomacy for the 
disarmament of Iraq. For the UK, regime change was a means to achieve 
disarmament, not an objective in its own right. 

Security Council on the need to achieve the disarmament of Iraq. 

*  The negotiation of resolution 1441 reflected a broad consensus in the UN 
*  To secure consensus in the Security Council despite the different positions of 
the US and France and Russia, resolution 1441 was a compromise containing 
drafting ‘fixes’. 

*  That created deliberate ambiguities on a number of key issues including: the 
level of non‑compliance with resolution 1441 which would constitute a material 
breach; by whom that determination would be made; and whether there would 
be a second resolution explicitly authorising the use of force.

## Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to 
January 2003
804.  The following key findings are from Section 3.6:

*  Following the adoption of resolution 1441, the UK was pursuing a strategy of 
coercive diplomacy to secure the disarmament of Iraq. The hope was that this 
might be achieved by peaceful means, but views differed on how likely that 
would be.

*  The UK Government remained convinced that Iraq had retained prohibited 

weapons and was pursuing chemical, biological and ballistic missile 
programmes in contravention of its obligations to disarm; and that the absence 
of evidence of weapons and programmes was the result of a successful policy 
of concealment.


*  By early January 2003, Mr Blair had concluded that Iraq had had “no change of 
heart” and military action to remove Saddam Hussein’s regime was likely to be 
required to disarm Iraq.

*  The US Administration was planning military action no later than early March. 
*  Mr Blair and Mr Straw concluded that a second UN resolution would be essential 
to secure domestic and international support for military action. In the absence 
of a “smoking gun”, that would require more time and a series of reports from 
the UN inspectors which established a pattern of Iraqi non‑compliance with 
its obligations.

*  Mr Blair secured President Bush’s support for a second resolution but did not 
secure agreement that the inspections process should continue until the end 
of March or early April. That left little time for the inspections process to provide 
the evidence that would be needed to achieve international agreement on the 
way ahead. 

## Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003
805.  The following key findings are from Section 3.7:

*  By the time the Security Council met on 7 March 2003 there were deep divisions 
*  Following President Bush’s agreement to support a second resolution to help 

within it on the way ahead on Iraq. 

Mr Blair, Mr Blair and Mr Straw continued during February and early March 2003 
to develop the position that Saddam Hussein was not co‑operating as required 
by resolution 1441 (2002) and, if that situation continued, a second resolution 
should be adopted stating that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered 
by the Security Council.

*  On 6 February, Mr Blair said that the UK would consider military action without 
a further resolution only if the inspectors reported that they could not do their 
job and a resolution was vetoed unreasonably. The UK would not take military 
action without a majority in the Security Council.

*  Mr Blair’s proposals, on 19 February, for a side statement defining tough tests 
for Iraq’s co‑operation and a deadline of 14 March for a vote by the Security 
Council, were not agreed by the US. 

*  The initial draft of a US, UK and Spanish resolution tabled on 24 February, which 
simply invited the Security Council to decide that Iraq had failed to take the final 
opportunity offered by resolution 1441, failed to attract support.

*  Throughout February, the divisions in the Security Council widened.
*  France, Germany and Russia set out their common position on 10 and 

24 February. Their joint Memorandum of 24 February called for a programme of 
continued and reinforced inspections with a clear timeline and a military build‑up 
to exert maximum pressure on Iraq to disarm.

*  The reports to the Security Council by the IAEA reported increasing indications 

of Iraqi co‑operation. On 7 March, Dr ElBaradei reported that there was no 
indication that Iraq had resumed nuclear activities and that it should be able 
to provide the Security Council with an assessment of Iraq’s activities in the 
near future.

*  Dr Blix reported to the Security Council on 7 March that there had been an 

acceleration of initiatives from Iraq and, while they did not constitute immediate 
co‑operation, they were welcome. UNMOVIC would be proposing a work 
programme for the Security Council’s approval, based on key tasks for Iraq to 
address. It would take months to verify sites and items, analyse documents, 
interview relevant personnel and draw conclusions.

*  A revised draft US, UK and Spanish resolution, tabled after the reports by Dr Blix 

and Dr ElBaradei on 7 March and proposing a deadline of 17 March for Iraq to 
demonstrate full co‑operation, also failed to attract support. 

*  China, France and Russia all stated that they did not favour a resolution 

authorising the use of force and that the Security Council should maintain its 
efforts to find a peaceful solution.

*  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that a “side statement” with defined benchmarks 
for Iraqi co‑operation could be needed to secure support from Mexico and Chile.
*  Mr Blair told President Bush that he would need a majority of nine votes in the 

Security Council for Parliamentary approval for UK military action.

## Iraq WMD assessments, pre‑July 2002
806.  The following key findings are from Section 4.1:

*  The ingrained belief that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and 
biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible 
enhance its capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear 
capability, and was pursuing an active policy of deception and concealment, had 
underpinned the UK Government’s policy towards Iraq since the Gulf Conflict 
ended in 1991.

*  Iraq’s chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes were seen as a 
threat to international peace and security in the Middle East, but overall, the 
threat from Iraq was viewed as less serious than that from other key countries 
of concern – Iran, Libya and North Korea. 

*  The Assessments issued by the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) reflected the 
uncertainties within the intelligence community about the detail of Iraq’s activities.
*  The statements prepared for, and used by, the UK Government in public from 
late 2001 onwards conveyed more certainty than the JIC Assessments about 
Iraq’s proscribed activities and the potential threat they posed.


*  The tendency to refer in public statements only to Iraq’s “weapons of mass 

destruction” was likely to have created the impression that Iraq posed a greater 
threat than the detailed JIC Assessments would have supported. 

*  There was nothing in the JIC Assessments issued before July 2002 that would 
have raised any questions in policy‑makers’ minds about the core construct of 
Iraq’s capabilities and intent. Indeed, from May 2001 onwards, the perception 
conveyed was that Iraqi activity could have increased since the departure of the 
weapons inspectors, funded by Iraq’s growing illicit income from circumventing 
the sanctions regime.

*  In the light of sensitivities about their content and significance, publication of 
documents on ‘Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction’, ‘Weapons Inspections’ 
and ‘Abuse of Human Rights’ was postponed until the policy on Iraq was clearer.

## Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002
807.  The following key findings are from Section 4.2:

*  The urgency and certainty with which the Government stated that Iraq was 
a threat which had to be dealt with fuelled the demand for publication of the 
dossier and led to Mr Blair’s decision to publish it in September, separate from 
any decision on the way ahead.

*  The dossier was designed to “make the case” and secure Parliamentary and 
public support for the Government’s position that action was urgently required 
to secure Iraq’s disarmament.

*  The JIC accepted ownership of the dossier and agreed its content. There is no 
evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No.10 
improperly influenced the text. 

*  The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt either that 

Saddam Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons 
or that efforts to develop nuclear weapons continued. The JIC should have 
made that clear to Mr Blair.

*  In his statement to Parliament on 24 September 2002, Mr Blair presented Iraq’s 
past, current and potential future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the 
potential threat from Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction; and that at some point 
in the future that threat would become a reality.

*  The dossier’s description of Iraq’s capabilities and intent became part of the 

baseline against which the UK Government measured Iraq’s future statements 
and actions and the success of weapons inspections.

*  The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated the 
firmness of the evidence has produced a damaging legacy which may make it 
more difficult to secure support for Government policy, including military action, 
where the evidence depends on inferential judgements drawn from intelligence.

*  There are lessons which should be implemented in using information from 

JIC Assessments to underpin policy decisions.

## Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003
808.  The following key findings are from Section 4.3:

*  The ingrained belief already described in this Section underpinned the UK 
Government’s position that Iraq was a threat that had to be dealt with and it 
needed to disarm or be disarmed. That remained the case up to and beyond 
the decision to invade Iraq in March 2003.

invasion, Saddam Hussein had taken a different position.

*  The judgements about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions relied too heavily on 
Iraq’s past behaviour being a reliable indicator of its current and future actions.
*  There was no consideration of whether, faced with the prospect of a US‑led 
*  The JIC made the judgements in the UK Government September dossier part

of the test for Iraq. 

biological or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either 
the JIC or the policy community.

*  A formal reassessment of the JIC’s judgements should have taken place after 

Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council on 14 February 2003 or, at the very latest, 
after his report of 7 March.

*  Intelligence and assessments made by the JIC about Iraq’s capabilities and 

intent continued to be used to prepare briefing material to support Government 
statements in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the 
limitations of the intelligence.

*  The independence and impartiality of the JIC remains of the utmost importance.
*  SIS had a responsibility to ensure that key recipients of its reporting were 
informed in a timely way when doubts arose about key sources and when, 
subsequently, intelligence was withdrawn. 

The search for WMD
809.  The following key findings are from Section 4.4:

*  The search for evidence of WMD in Iraq was started during the military 
campaign by Exploitation Task Force‑75 and was carried forward from 
June 2003 by the Iraq Survey Group (ISG). The UK participated in both.


*  As the insurgency developed, the ISG’s operating conditions became 

increasingly difficult. There was competition for resources between 
counter‑terrorism operations and the search for WMD evidence, and 
some ISG staff were diverted to the former.

*  Mr Blair took a close interest in the work of the ISG and the presentation 
of its reports and the wider narrative about WMD. He raised the subject 
with President Bush. 

*  The Government was confident that pre‑conflict assessments of Iraq’s WMD 
capabilities would be confirmed once Saddam Hussein’s regime had been 
removed.

*  It quickly became apparent that it was unlikely that significant stockpiles would 
be found. This led to challenges to the credibility of both the Government and 
the intelligence community.

*  There were soon demands for an independent judge‑led inquiry into the 
*  The Government was quick to acknowledge the need for a review, rejecting 

pre‑conflict intelligence. 

an independent inquiry in favour of reviews initiated by the House of Commons 
Foreign Affairs Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee of 
Parliament. 

*  The Government’s reluctance to establish an independent public inquiry became 

untenable in January 2004 when President Bush announced his own decision 
to set up an independent inquiry in the US.

*  Faced with criticism of the pre‑conflict intelligence and the absence of evidence 
of a current Iraqi WMD capability, Mr Blair sought to defend the decision to take 
military action by emphasising instead:

 * Saddam Hussein’s strategic intent;
 * the regime’s breaches of Security Council resolutions; and 
 * the positive impact of military action in Iraq on global counter‑proliferation efforts. 

*  The ISG’s principal findings – that Iraq’s WMD capability had mostly been 
destroyed in 1991 but that it had been Saddam Hussein’s strategic intent 
to preserve the capability to reconstitute his WMD – were significant, but 
did not support statements made by the UK and US Governments before the 
invasion, which had focused on Iraq’s current capabilities and an urgent and 
growing threat.

*  The explanation for military action put forward by Mr Blair in October 2004 drew 

on the ISG’s findings, but was not the explanation given before the conflict. 

# Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to 
March 2003
810.  The following key findings are from Section 5:

*  On 9 December, formal ‘instructions’ to provide advice were sent to Lord 

Goldsmith. They were sent by the FCO on behalf of the FCO and the MOD as 
well as No.10. The instructions made it clear that Lord Goldsmith should not 
provide an immediate response. 

*  Until 27 February, No.10 could not have been sure that Lord Goldsmith would 

advise that there was a basis on which military action against Iraq could be 
taken in the absence of a further decision of the Security Council. 

*  Lord Goldsmith’s formal advice of 7 March set out alternative interpretations 
of the legal effect of resolution 1441. While Lord Goldsmith remained “of the 
opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure a second resolution”, he 
concluded (paragraph 28) that “a reasonable case can be made that resolution 
1441 was capable of reviving the authorisation in resolution 678 without a further 
resolution”.

*  Lord Goldsmith wrote that a reasonable case did not mean that if the matter 
ever came to court, he would be confident that the court would agree with this 
view. He judged a court might well conclude that OPs 4 and 12 required a further 
Security Council decision in order to revive the authorisation in resolution 678.
*  At a meeting on 11 March, there was concern that the advice did not offer a 

clear indication that military action would be lawful. Lord Goldsmith was asked, 
after the meeting, by Admiral Boyce on behalf of the Armed Forces, and by the 
Treasury Solicitor, Ms Juliet Wheldon, in respect of the Civil Service, to give a 
clear‑cut answer on whether military action would be lawful rather than unlawful.
*  Lord Goldsmith concluded on 13 March that, on balance, the “better view” was 

that the conditions for the operation of the revival argument were met in this 
case, meaning that there was a lawful basis for the use of force without a further 
resolution beyond resolution 1441.

*  Mr Brummell wrote to Mr Rycroft on 14 March:

“It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further 
resolution of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq has 
failed to comply with and co‑operate fully in the implementation of resolution 
1441 and has thus failed to take the final opportunity offered by the Security 
Council in that resolution. The Attorney General understands that it is 
unequivocally the Prime Minister’s view that Iraq has committed further 
material breaches as specified in [operative] paragraph 4 of resolution 
1441, but as this is a judgment for the Prime Minister, the Attorney would 
be grateful for confirmation that this is the case.”


*  Mr Rycroft replied to Mr Brummell on 15 March:

“This is to confirm that it is indeed the Prime Minister’s unequivocal view 
that Iraq is in further material breach of its obligations, as in OP4 [operative 
paragraph 4] of UNSCR 1441, because of ‘false statements or omissions in 
the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure to 
comply with, and co‑operate fully in the interpretation of, this resolution’.”

*  Senior Ministers should have considered the question posed in Mr Brummell’s 
letter of 14 March, either in the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee or a 
“War Cabinet”, on the basis of formal advice. Such a Committee should then 
have reported its conclusions to Cabinet before its Members were asked to 
endorse the Government’s policy.

Baroness Ramsey setting out the legal basis for military action. 

*  Cabinet was provided with the text of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to 
*  That document represented a statement of the Government’s legal position – 
it did not explain the legal basis of the conclusion that Iraq had failed to take 
“the final opportunity” to comply with its disarmament obligations offered by 
resolution 1441. 

*  Cabinet was not provided with written advice which set out, as the advice 
of 7 March had done, the conflicting arguments regarding the legal effect of 
resolution 1441 and whether, in particular, it authorised military action without 
a further resolution of the Security Council. 

*  The advice should have been provided to Ministers and senior officials whose 
responsibilities were directly engaged and should have been made available 
to Cabinet. 

## Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq
811.  The following key findings are from Section 6.1:

*  The size and composition of a UK military contribution to the US‑led invasion of 
Iraq was largely discretionary. The US wanted some UK capabilities (including 
Special Forces), to use UK bases, and the involvement of the UK military to 
avoid the perception of unilateral US military action. The primary impetus to 
maximise the size of the UK contribution and the recommendations on its 
composition came from the Armed Forces, with the agreement of Mr Hoon.

*  From late February 2002, the UK judged that Saddam Hussein’s regime could 
*  In April 2002, the MOD advised that, if the US mounted a major military 

only be removed by a US‑led invasion.

operation, the UK should contribute a division comprising three brigades. That 
was perceived to be commensurate with the UK’s capabilities and the demands 
of the campaign. Anything smaller risked being compared adversely to the UK’s 
contribution to the liberation of Kuwait in 1991. 

*  The MOD saw a significant military contribution as a means of influencing 
*  Mr Blair and Mr Hoon wanted to keep open the option of contributing significant 

US decisions. 

forces for ground operations as long as possible, but between May and 
mid‑October consistently pushed back against US assumptions that the UK 
would provide a division.

*  Air and maritime forces were offered to the US for planning purposes 
*  The MOD advised in October that the UK was at risk of being excluded from 

in September. 

US plans unless it offered ground forces, “Package 3”, on the same basis as air 
and maritime forces. That could also significantly reduce the UK’s vulnerability 
to US requests to provide a substantial and costly contribution to post‑conflict 
operations. 

*  From August until December 2002, other commitments meant that UK 

planning for Package 3 was based on providing a divisional headquarters and 
an armoured brigade for operations in northern Iraq. That was seen as the 
maximum practicable contribution the UK could generate within the predicted 
timescales for US action.

*  The deployment was dependent on Turkey’s agreement to the transit of 
*  Mr Blair agreed to offer Package 3 on 31 October 2002.
*  That decision and its potential consequences were not formally considered 
*  In December 2002, the deployment of 3 Commando Brigade was identified as 
a way for the UK to make a valuable contribution in the initial stages of a land 
campaign if transit through Turkey was refused. The operational risks were not 
explicitly addressed. 

by a Cabinet Committee or reported to Cabinet. 

*  Following a visit to Turkey on 7 to 8 January 2003, Mr Hoon concluded that there 
would be no agreement to the deployment of UK ground forces through Turkey.
*  By that time, in any case, the US had asked the UK to deploy for operations 

in southern Iraq. 

## Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003
812.  The following key findings are from Section 6.2:

*  The decisions taken between mid‑December 2002 and mid‑January 2003 to 
increase the combat force deployed to three brigades and bring forward the 
date on which UK forces might participate in combat operations compressed 
the timescales available for preparation.


*  The decision to deploy a large scale force for potential combat operations 
was taken without collective Ministerial consideration of the decision and 
its implications.

*  The large scale force deployed was a one‑shot capability. It would have been 

difficult to sustain the force if combat operations had been delayed until autumn 
2003 or longer, and it constrained the capabilities which were available for a UK 
military contribution to post‑conflict operations.

## Military equipment (pre‑conflict)
813.  The following key findings are from Section 6.3:

*  The decisions taken between mid‑December 2002 and mid‑January 2003 
to increase combat forces and bring forward the date on which UK forces 
might participate in combat operations compressed the timescales available 
for preparation.

*  The achievements made in preparing the forces in the time available were very 
considerable, but the deployment of forces more quickly than anticipated in the 
Defence Planning Assumptions meant that there were some serious equipment 
shortfalls when conflict began.

*  Those shortfalls were exacerbated by the lack of an effective asset tracking 
system, a lesson from previous operations and exercises that the MOD had 
identified but not adequately addressed.

*  Ministers were not fully aware of the risks inherent in the decisions and the MOD 
and PJHQ were not fully aware of the situation on the ground during the conflict.

# Planning for a post‑Saddam Hussein Iraq
814.  The following key findings are from Section 6.4, and relate to evidence in 
Sections 6.4 and 6.5:

*  Before the invasion of Iraq, Ministers, senior officials and the UK military 
recognised that post‑conflict civilian and military operations were likely to 
be the strategically decisive phase of the Coalition’s engagement in Iraq.

*  UK planning and preparation for the post‑conflict phase of operations, which 

rested on the assumption that the UK would be able quickly to reduce its military 
presence in Iraq and deploy only a minimal number of civilians, were wholly 
inadequate.

*  The information available to the Government before the invasion provided a 

clear indication of the potential scale of the post‑conflict task and the significant 
risks associated with the UK’s proposed approach.

*  Foreseeable risks included post‑conflict political disintegration and extremist 

violence in Iraq, the inadequacy of US plans, the UK’s inability to exert 
significant influence on US planning and, in the absence of UN authorisation 

for the administration and reconstruction of post‑conflict Iraq, the reluctance 
of potential international partners to contribute to the post‑conflict effort. 

*  The Government, which lacked both clear Ministerial oversight of post‑conflict 

strategy, planning and preparation, and effective co‑ordination between 
government departments, failed to analyse or manage those risks adequately.

*  Mr Blair, who recognised the significance of the post‑conflict phase, did 
not press President Bush for definite assurances about US plans, did not 
consider or seek advice on whether the absence of a satisfactory plan called 
for reassessment of the terms of the UK’s engagement and did not make 
agreement on such a plan a condition of UK participation in military action.

# The invasion
815.  The following key findings are from Section 8:

and the fall of Baghdad.

*  It took less than a month to achieve the departure of Saddam Hussein 
*  The decision to advance into Basra was made by military commanders 
*  The UK was unprepared for the media response to the initial difficulties. It had

also underestimated the need for sustained communication of key strategic 
messages to inform public opinion about the objectives and progress of the 
military campaign, including in Iraq.

*  For any future military operations, arrangements to agree and disseminate key 
strategic messages need to be put in place, in both London and on the ground, 
before operations begin. 

*  The UK acceded to the post‑invasion US request that it assume leadership of a 
military Area of Responsibility (AOR) encompassing four provinces in southern 
Iraq, a position it then held for six years, without a formal Ministerial decision and 
without carrying out a robust analysis of the strategic implications for the UK or 
the military’s capacity to support the UK’s potential obligations in the region.

# The post‑conflict period
816.  The following key findings are from Section 9.8, and relate to evidence in 
Sections 9.1 to 9.7:

*  Between 2003 and 2009, the UK’s most consistent strategic objective in relation 
*  The UK struggled from the start to have a decisive effect on the Coalition 
Provisional Authority’s (CPA’s) policies, even though it was fully implicated 
in its decisions as joint Occupying Power.


*  US and UK strategies for Iraq began to diverge almost immediately after the 
conflict. Although the differences were managed, by early 2007 the UK was 
finding it difficult to play down the divergence, which was, by that point, striking. 

*  The UK missed clear opportunities to reconsider its military approach in 
*  Throughout 2004 and 2005, it appears that senior members of the Armed 

Multi‑National Division (South‑East). 

Forces reached the view that little more would be achieved in MND(SE) and that 
it would make more sense to concentrate military effort on Afghanistan where it 
might have greater effect. 

*  From July 2005 onwards, decisions in relation to resources for Iraq were made 
under the influence of the demands of the UK effort in Afghanistan. Although Iraq 
remained the stated UK main effort, the Government no longer had the option of 
a substantial reinforcement of its forces there. 

*  The UK’s plans to reduce troop levels depended on the transition of lead 

responsibility for security to the Iraqi Security Forces, even as the latter’s ability 
to take on that responsibility was in question. 

*  The UK spent time and energy on rewriting strategies, which tended to describe

a desired end state without setting out how it would be reached. 

objectives defined in January 2003.

# Reconstruction
817.  The following key findings are from Section 10.4, and relate to evidence in 
Sections 10.1 to 10.3:

required in Iraq. 

*  The UK failed to plan or prepare for the major reconstruction programme 
*  Reconstruction was the third pillar in a succession of UK strategies for Iraq. 
The Government never resolved how reconstruction would support broader 
UK objectives. 

*  Following the resignation of Ms Clare Short, the International Development 

Secretary, and the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1483 in May 2003, 
DFID assumed leadership of the UK’s reconstruction effort in Iraq. DFID would 
subsequently define, within the framework established by the Government, the 
scope and nature of that effort. 

focus and purpose of the UK’s reconstruction effort in Iraq. 

*  At key points, DFID should have considered strategic questions about the scale, 
*  The US‑led Coalition Provisional Authority excluded the UK from discussions 
on oil policy and on disbursements from the Development Fund for Iraq. 
*  Many of the failures which affected pre‑invasion planning and preparation 

persisted throughout the post‑conflict period. They included poor 

inter‑departmental co‑ordination, inadequate civilian military co‑operation and 
a failure to use resources coherently.

*  An unstable and insecure environment made it increasingly difficult to make 

progress on reconstruction. Although staff and contractors developed innovative 
ways to deliver projects and manage risks, the constraints were never 
overcome. Witnesses to the Inquiry identified some successes, in particular in 
building the capacity of central Iraqi Government institutions and the provincial 
government in Basra. 

*  Lessons learned through successive reviews of the UK approach to post‑conflict 
reconstruction and stabilisation, in Iraq and elsewhere, were not applied in Iraq.

# De‑Ba’athification
818.  The following key findings are from Section 11.2, and relate to evidence in 
Section 11.1:

*  Early decisions on the form of de‑Ba’athification and its implementation had 
*  Limiting de‑Ba’athification to the top three tiers of the party, rather than

Section 12.1:

*  Between 2003 and 2009, there was no coherent US/UK strategy for Security 
*  The UK began work on SSR in Iraq without a proper understanding of what 
*  The UK was unable to influence the US or engage it in a way that produced 
*  There was no qualitative way for the UK to measure progress. The focus on the 
quantity of officers trained for the Iraqi Security Forces, rather than the quality 
of officers, was simplistic and gave a misleading sense of comfort.

an Iraq‑wide approach.

*  After 2006, the UK’s determination to withdraw from Iraq meant that aspirations 
for the Iraqi Security Forces were lowered to what would be “good enough” for 
Iraq. It was never clear what that meant in practice.


*  The development of the Iraqi Army was considerably more successful than 
that of the Iraqi Police Service. But the UK was still aware before it withdrew 
from Iraq that the Iraqi Army had not been sufficiently tested. The UK was not 
confident that the Iraqi Army could maintain security without support.

# Resources
820.  The following key findings are from Section 13.2, and relate to evidence in 
Section 13.1:

*  The direct cost of the conflict in Iraq was at least £9.2bn (the equivalent of 
£11.83bn in 2016). In total, 89 percent of that was spent on military operations. 
*  The Government’s decision to take part in military action against Iraq was not 

affected by consideration of the potential financial cost to the UK of the invasion 
or the post‑conflict period.

*  Ministers were not provided with estimates of military conflict and post‑conflict 
costs, or with advice on their affordability, when decisions were taken on the 
scale of the UK’s military contribution to a US‑led invasion of Iraq, and on the 
UK’s role in the post‑conflict period. They should have been.

did not constrain the UK military’s ability to conduct operations in Iraq. 

*  The controls imposed by the Treasury on the MOD’s budget in September 2003 
*  The Government was slow to recognise that Iraq was an enduring operation, 
and to adapt its funding arrangements to support both military operations and 
civilian activities. 

*  The arrangements for securing funding for civilian activities could be slow 
and unpredictable. Some high‑priority civilian activities were funded late or 
only in part. 

# Military equipment (post‑conflict)
821.  The following key findings are from Section 14.2, and relate to evidence in 
Section 14.1:

*  Between 2003 and 2009, UK forces in Iraq faced gaps in some key capability 
areas, including protected mobility, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition 
and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) and helicopter support. 

*  It was not sufficiently clear which person or department within the MOD had 

responsibility for identifying and articulating capability gaps.

*  Delays in providing adequate medium weight Protected Patrol Vehicles (PPVs) 

and the failure to meet the needs of UK forces in MND(SE) for ISTAR and 
helicopters should not have been tolerated.

*  The MOD was slow in responding to the developing threat in Iraq from 

Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The range of protected mobility options 
available to commanders in MND(SE) was limited. Although work had begun 
before 2002 to source an additional PPV, it was only ordered in July 2006 
following Ministerial intervention. 

*  Funding was not a direct barrier to the identification and deployment of 

additional solutions to the medium weight PPV gap. But it appears that the 
longer‑term focus of the Executive Committee of the Army Board on the 
Future Rapid Effect System programme inhibited it from addressing the more 
immediate issue related to medium weight PPV capability.

*  The decision to deploy troops to Afghanistan had a material impact on the 
availability of key capabilities for deployment to Iraq, particularly helicopters 
and ISTAR.

# Civilian personnel
822.  The following key findings are from Section 15.2, and relate to evidence in 
Section 15.1:

preparations for the deployment of civilian personnel.

*  Before the invasion of Iraq, the Government had made only minimal 
*  There was an enduring gap between the Government’s civilian capacity and 
*  There was no overarching consideration by the Government of the extent to 
which civilians could be effective in a highly insecure environment, or of the 
security assets needed for civilians to do their jobs effectively.

the level of its ambition in Iraq.

*  The evidence seen by the Inquiry indicates that the Government recognised its 
duty of care to UK‑based and locally engaged civilians in Iraq. A significant effort 
was made to keep civilians safe in a dangerous environment.

# Service Personnel
823.  The following key findings are from Section 16.4, and relate to evidence in 
Sections 16.1 to 16.3:

*  In 2002, the UK military was already operating at, and in some cases beyond, 
the limits of the guidelines agreed in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. As 
a result, the Harmony Guidelines were being breached for some units and 
specialist trades.

*  The Government’s decision to contribute a military force to a US‑led invasion 
of Iraq inevitably increased the risk that more Service Personnel would be put 


in breach of the Harmony Guidelines. The issue of the potential pressure on 
Service Personnel was not a consideration in the decision. 

*  The MOD planned and prepared effectively to provide medical care in support 
*  There were major improvements in the provision of medical care, mental 

of Operation TELIC. 

healthcare and rehabilitative care available to Service Personnel over the course 
of Op TELIC. 

*  Most of the contacts between the MOD and bereaved families were conducted 
with sensitivity. In a few cases, they were not. The MOD progressively improved 
how it engaged with and supported bereaved families, in part driven by 
consistent public and Ministerial pressure.

*  The Government’s decision in 2006 to deploy a second medium scale force 

to Helmand province in Afghanistan further increased the pressure on Service 
Personnel, on elements of the MOD’s welfare, medical and investigative 
systems, and the coronial system.

than react to them. 

*  The MOD made a number of improvements to the Board of Inquiry process, but 

some proposals for more substantive reform (including the introduction of an 
independent member) were not fully explored. The MOD significantly improved 
the way it communicated with and supported bereaved families in relation to 
military investigations and inquests. 

*  The MOD was less effective at providing support to Service Personnel who were 
mobilised individually (a category which included almost all Reservists) and their 
families, than to formed units. 

# Civilian casualties
824.  The following key findings are from Section 17:

*  The Inquiry considers that a Government has a responsibility to make every 

reasonable effort to understand the likely and actual effects of its military actions 
on civilians. 

*  In the months before the invasion, Mr Blair emphasised the need to minimise 
the number of civilian casualties arising from an invasion of Iraq. The MOD’s 
responses offered reassurance based on the tight targeting procedures 
governing the air campaign.

*  The MOD made only a broad estimate of direct civilian casualties arising from

period to determine the number of civilian casualties and the broader effects of 
military operations on civilians. More time was devoted to the question of which 
department should have responsibility for the issue of civilian casualties than it 
was to efforts to determine the actual number. 

*  The Government’s consideration of the issue of Iraqi civilian casualties was 

driven by its concern to rebut accusations that Coalition Forces were responsible 
for the deaths of large numbers of civilians, and to sustain domestic support for 
operations in Iraq. 

# Lessons
825.  In a number of Sections of this Report, the Inquiry has set out explicit lessons. 
They relate in particular to those elements of the UK’s engagement in Iraq which might 
be replicated in future operations. 

826.  The decision to join the US‑led invasion of Iraq in 2003 was the product of a 
particular set of circumstances which are unlikely to be repeated. Unlike other instances 
in which military force has been used, the invasion was not prompted by the aggression 
of another country or an unfolding humanitarian disaster. The lessons drawn by the 
Inquiry on the pre‑conflict element of this Report are therefore largely context‑specific 
and embedded in its conclusions. Lessons on collective Ministerial decision‑making, 
where the principles identified are enduring ones, are an exception. They, and other 
lessons which have general application, are set out below. 

# The decision to go to war
827.  In a democratic system, public support and understanding for a major military 
operation are essential. It is therefore important to guard against overstating what 
military action might achieve and against any tendency to play down the risks. A realistic 
assessment of the possibilities and limitations of armed force, and of the challenges of 
intervening in the affairs of other States, should help any future UK Government manage 
expectations, including its own.

828.  When the potential for military action arises, the Government should not 
commit to a firm political objective before it is clear that it can be achieved. Regular 
reassessment is essential, to ensure that the assumptions upon which policy is being 
made and implemented remain correct.

829.  Once an issue becomes a matter for the Security Council, the UK Government 
cannot expect to retain control of how it is to be discussed and eventually decided 
unless it is able to work with the interests and agendas of other Member States. 
In relation to Iraq, the independent role of the inspectors was a further dimension. 


830.  A military timetable should not be allowed to dictate a diplomatic timetable. 
If a strategy of coercive diplomacy is being pursued, forces should be deployed in 
such a way that the threat of action can be increased or decreased according to the 
diplomatic situation and the policy can be sustained for as long as necessary. 

831.  The issue of influencing the US, both at the strategic and at the operational level, 
was a constant preoccupation at all levels of the UK Government. 

832.  Prime Ministers will always wish to exercise their own political judgement on 
how to handle the relationship with the US. It will depend on personal relationships as 
well as on the nature of the issues being addressed. On all these matters of strategy 
and diplomacy, the Inquiry recognises that there is no standard formula that will be 
appropriate in all cases.

833.  Whether or not influence has been exercised can be difficult to ascertain, even 
in retrospect. The views of allies are most likely to make a difference when they come 
in one side of an internal debate, and there are a number of instances where the UK 
arguments did make a difference to the formation and implementation of US policy. 
The US and UK are close allies, but the relationship between the two is unequal. 

834.  The exercise of influence will always involve a combination of identifying the 
prerequisites for success in a shared endeavour, and a degree of bargaining to make 
sure that the approach meets the national interest. In situations like the run‑up to the 
invasion of Iraq:

*  If certain measures are identified as prerequisite for success then their 

importance should be underlined from the start. There are no prizes for sharing 
a failure.

*  Those measures that are most important should be pursued persistently and 
*  If it is assumed that a consequence of making a contribution in one area is 

consistently. 

that a further contribution would not be required in another, then that should be 
made explicit. 

*  Influence should not be set as an objective in itself. The exercise of influence is 

a means to an end.

# Weapons of mass destruction
835.  There will continue to be demands for factual evidence to explain the background 
to controversial policy decisions including, where appropriate, the explicit and public use 
of assessed intelligence.

836.  The Inquiry shares the Butler Review’s conclusions that it was a mistake not to 
see the risk of combining in the September dossier the JIC’s assessment of intelligence 
and other evidence with the interpretation and presentation of the evidence in order to 
make the case for policy action.

837.  The nature of the two functions is fundamentally different. As can be seen from 
the JIC Assessments quoted in, and published with, this report, they contain careful 
language intended to ensure that no more weight is put on the evidence than it can bear. 
Organising the evidence in order to present an argument in the language of Ministerial 
statements produces a quite different type of document. 

838.  The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated the 
firmness of the evidence about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions in order to influence 
opinion and “make the case” for action to disarm Iraq has produced a damaging legacy, 
including undermining trust and confidence in Government statements, particularly those 
which rely on intelligence which cannot be independently verified.

839.  As a result, in situations where the policy response may involve military action and 
the evidence, at least in part, depends on inferential judgements drawn from necessarily 
incomplete intelligence, it may be more difficult to secure support for the Government’s 
position and agreement to action.

840.  The explicit and public use of material from JIC Assessments to underpin policy 
decisions will be infrequent. But, from the evidence on the compilation of the September 
dossier, the lessons for any similar exercise in future would be:

*  The need for clear separation of the responsibility for analysis and assessment 
of intelligence from the responsibility for making the argument for a policy.
*  The importance of precision in describing the position. In the case of the 

September dossier, for instance, the term “programme” was used to describe 
disparate activities at very different stages of maturity. There was a “programme” 
to extend the range of the Al Samoud missile. There was no “programme” 
in any meaningful sense to develop and produce nuclear weapons. Use of 
the shorthand CW or BW in relation to Iraq’s capability obscured whether the 
reference was to weapons or warfare. Constant use of the term “weapons of 
mass destruction” without further clarification obscured the differences between 
the potential impact of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and the 
ability to deliver them effectively. For example, there would be a considerable 
difference between the effects of an artillery shell filled with mustard gas, which 
is a battlefield weapon, and a long‑range ballistic missile with a chemical or 
biological warhead, which is a weapon of terror. 

*  The need to identify and accurately describe the confidence and robustness of 
the evidence base. There may be evidence which is “authoritative” or which puts 
an issue “beyond doubt”; but there are unlikely to be many circumstances when 
those descriptions could properly be applied to inferential judgements relying on 
intelligence. 

*  The need to be explicit about the likelihood of events. The possibility of Iraq 

producing and using an improvised nuclear device was, rightly, omitted from the 
dossier. But the claim that Iraq could build a nuclear weapon within one to two 


years if it obtained fissile material and other essential components from foreign 
sources was included without addressing how feasible and likely that would 
be. In addition, the Executive Summary gave prominence to the International 
Institute of Strategic Studies suggestion that Iraq would be able to assemble 
nuclear weapons within months if it could obtain fissile material, without 
reference to the material in the main text of the dossier which made clear that 
the UK took a very different view.

*  The need for vigilance to avoid unwittingly crossing the line from supposition to

certainty, including by constant repetition of received wisdom.

841.  When assessed intelligence is explicitly and publicly used to support a policy 
decision, there would be benefit in subjecting that assessment and the underpinning 
intelligence to subsequent scrutiny, by a suitable, independent body, such as the 
Intelligence and Security Committee, with a view to identifying lessons for the future.

842.  In the context of the lessons from the preparation of the September 2002 dossier, 
the Inquiry identifies in Section 4.2 the benefits of separating the responsibilities for 
assessment of intelligence from setting out the arguments in support of a policy.

843.  The evidence in Section 4.3 reinforces that lesson. It shows that the intelligence 
and assessments made by the JIC about Iraq’s capabilities and intent continued to be 
used to prepare briefing material to support Government statements in a way which 
conveyed certainty without acknowledging the limitations of the intelligence.

844.  The independence and impartiality of the JIC remains of the utmost importance. 

845.  As the Foreign Affairs Committee report in July 2003 pointed out, the late 
Sir Percy Cradock wrote in his history of the JIC that:

“Ideally, intelligence and policy should be close but distinct. Too distinct and 
assessments become an in‑growing, self‑regarding activity, producing little or no 
work of interest to the decision‑makers ... Too close a link and policy begins to play 
back on estimates, producing the answers the policy makers would like ... The 
analysts become courtiers, whereas their proper function is to report their findings 
... without fear or favour. The best arrangement is intelligence and policy in separate 
but adjoining rooms, with communicating doors and thin partition walls ...”280 

846.  Mr Straw told the FAC in 2003:

“The reason why we have a Joint Intelligence Committee which is separate from the 
intelligence agencies is precisely so that those who are obtaining the intelligence are 

280 Cradock, Sir Percy. Know your enemy – How the Joint Intelligence Committee saw the World. 
John Murray, 2002.

not then directly making the assessment upon it. That is one of the very important 
strengths of our system compared with most other systems around the world.”281

847.  The FAC endorsed those sentiments.282 It stated that the JIC has a “vital role 
in safeguarding the independence and impartiality of intelligence”; and that the 
“independence and impartiality of its own role” was “of the utmost importance”. 
It recommended that Ministers should “bear in mind at all times the importance of 
ensuring that the JIC is free of all political pressure”.

848.  In its response to the FAC, the Government stated:

“We agree. The JIC plays a crucial role in providing the Government with objective 
assessments on a range of issues of importance to national interests.”283

# The invasion of Iraq
849.  The military plan for the invasion of Iraq depended for success on a rapid 
advance on Baghdad, including convincing the Iraqi population of the Coalition’s 
determination to remove the regime. 

850.  By the end of March, the Government had recognised the need for sustained 
communication of key strategic messages and improved capabilities to reach a range 
of audiences in the UK, Iraq and the wider international community. But there was clearly 
a need for more robust arrangements to integrate Coalition efforts in the UK, US and the 
forces deployed in Iraq. 

851.  The reaction of the media and the Iraqi population to perceived difficulties 
encountered within days of the start of an operation, which was planned to last up to 
125 days, might have been anticipated if there had been more rigorous examination 
of possible scenarios pre‑conflict and the media had better understood the original 
concept of operations and the nature of the Coalition responses to the situations they 
encountered once the campaign began.

852.  The difficulty and complexity of successfully delivering distinct strategic messages 
to each of the audiences a government needs to reach should not be underestimated. 
For any future military operations, arrangements tailored to meet the circumstances 
of each operation need to be put in place in both London and on the ground before 
operations begin. 

281 Ninth Report from the Foreign Affairs Committee, Session 2002‑2003, 7 July 2003, The Decision to go 
to War in Iraq, HC 813‑1, paragraph 153. 
282 Ninth Report from the Foreign Affairs Committee, Session 2002‑2003, 7 July 2003, The Decision to go 
to War in Iraq, HC 813‑1, paragraphs 156‑157.
283 Foreign Secretary, November 2003, The Decision to go to War in Iraq Response of the Secretary of 
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, November 2003, Cm6062, paragraph 27.


853.  When the UK acceded to the US request that it assume leadership of a military 
Area of Responsibility encompassing four provinces in southern Iraq, it did so without a 
robust analysis either of the strategic implications for the UK or of the military’s capacity 
to support the UK’s potential obligations in the region. 

854.  A step of such magnitude should be taken deliberately and having considered the 
wider strategic and resource implications and contingent liabilities. 

855.  That requires all government departments whose responsibilities will be engaged 
to have been formally involved in providing Ministers with coherent inter‑departmental 
advice before decisions are taken; the proper function of the Cabinet Committee system. 

# The post‑conflict period
856.  The UK had not participated in an opposed invasion and full‑scale occupation of 
a sovereign State (followed by shared responsibility for security and reconstruction over 
a long period) since the end of the Second World War. The particular circumstances of 
Op TELIC are unlikely to recur. Nevertheless, there are lessons to be drawn about major 
operations abroad and the UK’s approach to armed intervention.

857.  The UK did not achieve its objectives, despite the best efforts and acceptance of 
risk in a dangerous environment by military and civilian personnel.

858.  Although the UK expected to be involved in Iraq for a lengthy period after the 
conflict, the Government was unprepared for the role in which the UK found itself from 
April 2003. Much of what went wrong stemmed from that lack of preparation.

859.  In any undertaking of this kind, certain fundamental elements are of vital 
importance:

*  the best possible appreciation of the theatre of operations, including the political, 

cultural and ethnic background, and the state of society, the economy and 
infrastructure;

*  a hard‑headed assessment of risks;
*  objectives which are realistic within that context, and if necessary limited – rather 
*  allocation of the resources necessary for the task – both military and civil.

than idealistic and based on optimistic assumptions; and

860.  All of these elements were lacking in the UK’s approach to its role in 
post‑conflict Iraq.

861.  Where responsibility is to be shared, it is essential to have written agreement 
in advance on how decision‑making and governance will operate within an alliance or 
coalition. The UK normally acts with allies, as it did in Iraq. Within the NATO Alliance, 
the rules and mechanisms for decision‑taking and the sharing of responsibility have 
been developed over time and are well understood. The Coalition in Iraq, by contrast, 

was an ad hoc alliance. The UK tried to establish some governance principles in 
the Memorandum of Understanding proposed to the US, but did not press the point. 
This led the UK into the uncomfortable and unsatisfactory situation of accepting 
shared responsibility without the ability to make a formal input to the process of 
decision‑making. 

862.  As Iraq showed, the pattern set in the initial stage of an intervention is crucial. 
The maximum impact needs to be made in the early weeks and months, or opportunities 
missed may be lost for ever. It is very difficult to recover from a slow or damaging start. 

863.  Ground truth is vital. Over‑optimistic assessments lead to bad decisions. Senior 
decision‑makers – Ministers, Chiefs of Staff, senior officials – must have a flow of 
accurate and frank reporting. A “can do” attitude is laudably ingrained in the UK Armed 
Forces – a determination to get on with the job, however difficult the circumstances – 
but this can prevent ground truth from reaching senior ears. At times in Iraq, the bearers 
of bad tidings were not heard. On several occasions, decision‑makers visiting Iraq 
(including the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Chief of the General Staff) 
found the situation on the ground to be much worse than had been reported to them. 
Effective audit mechanisms need to be used to counter optimism bias, whether through 
changes in the culture of reporting, use of multiple channels of information – internal 
and external – or use of visits. 

864.  It is important to retain a flexible margin of resources – in personnel, equipment 
and financing – and the ability to change tactics to deal with adverse developments 
on the ground. In Iraq, that flexibility was lost after the parallel deployment to Helmand 
province in Afghanistan, which both constrained the supply of equipment (such as 
ISTAR) and took away the option of an effective reinforcement. Any decision to deploy 
to the limit of capabilities entails a high level of risk. In relation to Iraq, the risks involved 
in the parallel deployment of two enduring medium scale operations were not examined 
with sufficient rigour and challenge. 

865.  The management, in Whitehall, of a cross‑government effort on the scale which 
was required in Iraq is a complex task. It needs dedicated leadership by someone with 
time, energy and influence. It cannot realistically be done by a Prime Minister alone, but 
requires a senior Minister with lead responsibility who has access to the Prime Minister 
and is therefore able to call on his or her influence in resolving problems or conflicts. 
A coherent inter‑departmental effort, supported by a structure able to hold departments 
to account, is required to support such a Minister.

# Reconstruction
866.  The starting point for all discussions of reconstruction in circumstances 
comparable to those in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 must be that this is an area where 
progress will be extremely difficult.


867.  Better planning and preparation for a post‑Saddam Hussein Iraq would not 
necessarily have prevented the events that unfolded in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. 
It would not have been possible for the UK to prepare for every eventuality. Better 
plans and preparation could have mitigated some of the risks to which the UK and Iraq 
were exposed between 2003 and 2009 and increased the likelihood of achieving the 
outcomes desired by the UK and the Iraqi people.

868.  From late 2003, successive reviews of the UK’s approach to post‑conflict 
reconstruction, later expanded to include the broader concept of stabilisation, resulted 
in a series of changes to the UK’s approach to post‑conflict operations. Despite those 
changes, many of the shortcomings that characterised the UK Government’s approach to 
pre‑conflict planning and preparation in 2002 and early 2003 persisted after the invasion. 

869.  The UK Government’s new strategic framework for stabilisation, the new 
machinery for inter‑departmental co‑ordination and the enhanced resources now 
available for stabilisation operations continue to evolve. If future changes are to increase 
the effectiveness of UK operations, they must address the lessons for planning, 
preparation and implementation derived from the Iraq experience. 

870.  The lessons identified by the Inquiry apply to both the planning and preparation 
for post‑conflict operations, of which reconstruction is a major but not the sole 
component, and to post‑conflict operations themselves. 

871.  Analysis of the available material must draw on multiple perspectives, reflect 
dissenting views, identify risk – including that associated with any gaps in knowledge – 
and consider a range of options. 

872.  Information must be shared as widely across departments as is necessary to 
support that approach. 

873.  Gathering information and analysis of the nature and scale of the potential task 
should be systematic and as thorough as possible, and should capture the views and 
aspirations of local communities. 

874.  Plans derived from that analysis should:

*  incorporate a range of options appropriate to different contingencies; 
*  reflect a realistic assessment of UK (and partners’) resources and capabilities; 
*  integrate civilian and military objectives and capabilities in support of a single 
*  be exposed to scrutiny and challenge at Ministerial, senior official and expert 
*  be reviewed regularly and, if the strategic context, risk profile or projected cost 

UK strategy; 

level;

changes significantly, be revised.

875.  A government must prepare for a range of scenarios, not just the best case, and 
should not assume that it will be able to improvise. 

876.  Where the UK is the junior partner and is unable during planning or 
implementation to secure the outcome it requires, it should take stock of whether to 
attach conditions to continued participation and whether further involvement would be 
consistent with the UK’s strategic interest.

877.  Public statements on the extent of the UK’s ambition should reflect a realistic 
assessment of what is achievable. To do otherwise is to risk even greater disillusionment 
and a loss of UK credibility.

878.  Departmental priorities and interests will inevitably continue to diverge even 
where an inter‑departmental body with a cross‑government role, currently the 
Stabilisation Unit (SU), is in place. Therefore, co‑operation between departments needs 
continual reinforcement at official and Ministerial levels. 

879.  The Head of the SU must be sufficiently senior and the SU enjoy recognition 
inside and outside government as a centre of excellence in its field if the Unit is to have 
credibility and influence in No.10, the National Security Council, the Treasury, the FCO, 
DFID and the MOD, and with the military. 

# De‑Ba’athification
880.  After the fall of a repressive regime, steps inevitably have to be taken to prevent 
those closely identified with that regime from continuing to hold positions of influence 
in public life. The development of plans which minimise undesired consequences, 
which are administered with justice and which are based on a robust understanding 
of the social context in which they will be implemented, should be an essential part 
of preparation for any post‑conflict phase. This should include measures designed to 
address concerns within the wider population, including those of the victims of the old 
regime, and to promote reconciliation.

881.  It is vital to define carefully the scope of such measures. Bringing too many or too 
few individuals within scope of measures like de‑Ba’athification can have far‑reaching 
consequences for public sector capacity and for the restoration of public trust in the 
institutions of government. 

882.  It is also important to think through the administrative implications of the 
measures to be applied and the process for their implementation. 

883.  The potential for abuse means that it is essential to have thought‑through forms of 
oversight that are as impartial and non‑partisan as possible. 

# Security Sector Reform
884.  An SSR strategy should define the functions of different elements of the relevant 
security sector and the structures needed to perform those functions. Considering those 
questions should drive a robust debate about how security requirements might change 
over time. 

885.  An understanding of the many different models that exist internationally for 
internal security, policing and criminal justice is essential. But those models cannot 
be considered in isolation because what works in one country will not necessarily 
work in another which may have very different traditions. It is therefore critical for the 
SSR strategy to take full account of the history, culture and inherited practices of the 
country or region in question. The strategy also needs to be informed by the views and 
aspirations of the local population. 

886.  A strategy should set out the desired operating standard for each function and 
state how that differs, if at all, from what exists. In doing so, the strategy should specify 
where capacity needs to be developed and inform a serious assessment of how the 
material resources available could best be deployed. 

887.  It is essential that the UK has an appropriate way to measure the success of any 
SSR plan. If a clear strategy is in place and has taken account of the views of the local 
population, the indicators of that success should be obvious. It should rarely concentrate 
on a one‑dimensional set of numbers but instead be a more qualitative and rounded 
assessment.

# Resources
888.  The direction in the Ministerial Code that the estimate of a cost of a proposal 
should be included in the memorandum submitted to Cabinet or a Ministerial Committee 
applies equally to military operations. When evaluating military options it is appropriate 
to consider financial risk alongside other forms of risk. While governments will rarely 
wish to preclude options solely on the basis of cost, they must also recognise that, over 
time, cost may become an issue and make it difficult to sustain a military operation over 
the longer term. 

889.  Strategies and plans must define the resources required to deliver objectives, 
identify the budget(s) that will provide those resources, and confirm that those resources 
are available. 

890.  In developing strategies and plans for civilian/military operations, a government 
should address the impact of the different mechanisms used to fund military operations 
and civilian activities and the extent to which those mechanisms provide perverse 
incentives for military action by making it easier to secure funding for agreed military 
operations than for civilian activities. 

891.  A government should also address its explicit and implicit financial policy that, 
while there should be no constraint on the provision of funding for military operations, 
it is reasonable that for the same civilian/military operation, departments should find 
funding for new civilian activities from within their existing budgets, which are likely to be 
fully allocated to existing departmental priorities. 

892.  A government is likely to embark on major civilian/military operations such as Iraq 
only rarely. 

893.  A government should recognise that, in such operations, the civilian components 
(including diplomatic activity, reconstruction and Security Sector Reform) will be critical 
for strategic success, may be very substantial, and must be properly resourced. 

894.  One arrangement would be to create a budget for the civilian components of the 
operation, under the direction of a senior Minister with lead responsibility and in support 
of a coherent UK strategy. Once allocations were made from that budget to individual 
departments, the allocations would be managed within departments’ legal and policy 
constraints. Such an arrangement should: 

*  ensure that UK strategy was resourced; 
*  promote joint working;
*  minimise the potential for gaming;
*  be able to respond to in‑year priorities; and 
*  reduce the amount of time that Ministers and senior officials need to spend 

arguing about funding individual activities. 

895.  The Inquiry recognises that, since 2003, significant changes have been made to 
the UK’s strategic and operational approach to reconstruction and stabilisation, including 
to the arrangements for funding such operations. 

# Military equipment (post‑conflict)
896.  In deciding to undertake concurrent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the UK 
knowingly exceeded the Defence Planning Assumptions. All resources from that point 
onwards were going to be stretched. Any decision which commits the UK to extended 
operations in excess of the Defence Planning Assumptions should be based on the most 
rigorous analysis of its potential implications, including for the availability of relevant 
capabilities for UK forces. 

897.  At the start of Op TELIC, the MOD knew that it had capability gaps in relation 
to protected mobility and ISTAR and that either could have a significant impact on 
operations. Known gaps in such capabilities should always be clearly communicated 
to Ministers.

898.  The MOD should be pro‑active in seeking to understand and articulate new or 
additional equipment requirements. The MOD told the Inquiry that there was no simple 


answer to the question of where the primary responsibility for identifying capability gaps 
lay during Op TELIC. That is unacceptable. The roles and responsibilities for identifying 
and articulating capability gaps in enduring operations must be clearly defined, 
communicated and understood by those concerned. It is possible that this has been 
addressed after the period covered by this Inquiry. 

899.  Those responsible for making decisions on the investment in military capabilities 
should continually evaluate whether the balance between current operational 
requirements and long‑term defence programmes is right, particularly to meet an 
evolving threat on current operations.

900.  During the first four years of Op TELIC, there was no clear statement of policy 
setting out the acceptable level of risk to UK forces and who was responsible for 
managing that risk. The MOD has suggested to the Inquiry that successive policies 
defining risk ownership and governance more clearly have addressed that absence, 
and that wider MOD risk management processes have also been revised. In any future 
operation the level of force protection required to meet the assessed threat needs to be 
addressed explicitly. 

# Civilian personnel
901.  The Inquiry recognises that, since 2003, significant changes have been made to 
the UK’s strategic and operational approach to reconstruction and stabilisation. Some 
of those changes, including the establishment of a deployable UK civilian stand‑by 
capability, are the direct result of lessons learned from serious shortcomings in the 
deployment of civilian personnel in post‑conflict Iraq. 

902.  The effectiveness of the UK civilian effort in post‑conflict Iraq was compromised 
by a range of factors, including the absence of effective cross‑government co‑ordination 
on risk, duty of care and the terms and conditions applicable to personnel serving  
in Iraq. 

903.  The difficult working conditions for civilians in Iraq were reflected in short 
tour lengths and frequent leave breaks. Different departments adopted different 
arrangements throughout the Iraq campaign, leading to concerns about breaks 
in continuity, loss of momentum, lack of institutional memory and insufficient local 
knowledge.

904.  Different departments will continue to deploy civilian staff in different roles. 
Standardisation of all aspects of those deployments may not be appropriate, but greater 
harmonisation of departmental policies should be considered wherever possible. 
The same approach should be applied to locally engaged (LE) staff.

905.  At all stages, including planning, departments must give full consideration to their 
responsibilities and duty of care towards LE staff, who have an essential contribution to 
make and will face particular risks in insecure environments. 

906.  All civilian deployments should be assessed and reviewed against a single, 
rigorous, cross‑government framework for risk management. The framework should 
provide the means for the Government as a whole to strike an effective balance between 
security and operational effectiveness, and to take timely decisions on the provision of 
appropriate security measures.

907.  Standardising tour lengths for civilians deployed by different departments would 
have eased the overall administrative burden and, perhaps, some of the tensions 
between individuals from different government departments serving in Iraq. But the 
environment was difficult and individuals’ resilience and circumstances varied. 
The introduction of the option to extend a tour of duty was an appropriate response. 

908.  Throughout any operation of this kind, departments should maintain two 
procedures for the systematic debriefing of staff returning to the UK: one to meet duty 
of care obligations, the other to learn lessons from their experience. 

909.  In order to identify individuals with the right skills, there must be clarity about the 
roles they are to perform. Wherever possible, individuals should be recruited for and 
deployed to clearly defined roles appropriate to their skills and seniority. They must be 
provided with the equipment needed to perform those roles to a high standard. 

910.  The Government should consider the introduction of a mechanism for responding 
to a surge in demand for a particular language capability.

911.  The Inquiry views the inability of the FCO, the MOD and DFID to confirm how 
many civilian personnel were deployed to or employed in Iraq, in which locations and 
in what roles, as a serious failure. Data management systems must provide accurate 
information on the names, roles and locations of all staff for whom departments have 
duty of care responsibilities.
